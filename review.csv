"I am comparing the Momentum 3 with Sony WH-1000XM3 that I also own. I am using Galaxy S10,  Macbook Pro 2017, Tidal Hifi to test them. Sound: It is definitely an upgrade from the Sony. Much better sound stage and warmer sound. Bass is a bit boosted but the phone app has EQ, so you can tune it the way you want. I noticed cracking/popping sound when I use it with Macbook pro. It pops for a few seconds for every song. No issue with my phone. Both MBP and GS10 are using APTX. Noise cancelling: Very disappointing. It can block some fan/AC noise. But totally unable to block datacenter server noise. The Sony won by a mile. Comfort: Material is premium. Clamming force is just about the right amount to keep it on my head securely. Heavier than Sony but not enough to bother me. I still give Sony a slight win in this department. Portability: It does not fold flat like the Sony. So the carrying case is a lot bigger than Sony's. And the case is not hard enough to protect the headphones. And since it doesn't fold flat, you can't hang it around the neck. Sony +1. Features: Connect 2 devices at once. This should be industry standard, but Sony can only do 1 at a time. Momentum 3 auto pause when you take off headphones, I love it. Physical buttons, I like it more than touch ear cups on the Sony. Conclusion: I bought these headphones hoping to replace my Sony. But I think I can only use this in the office. Its difficult to carry around and noise cancelling is pretty useless. If I can only keep one pair, I will choose the Sony. One last thing, for $400, a pair of sound quality focus headphones don't have APTX-HD support? Come on, Sennheiser!",4.0
"An unbiased review that represents my search for a multipurpose high quality over the ear headphone. See update at bottom of review As a premise that there is no single headphone that works for everyone and every situation, no single item is perfect for everyone and everything. I have wireless earbuds for working out, the Jabra 65T active, and love the Jaybird Vista wireless for use when working long term use during the day. I also have a pair of Sony over the ear headphones, the WMH 900N for sound suppression when working outdoors. I wanted improved sound and didn't need absolute noise cancellation for the loudest of environments. I was looking for good blue tooth sync without audio/video delay, and some sound isolation. Also, the need for Bluetooth 5 was a relative need in order to allow syncing to more than one device. I did look at the Bose and the Sony WH1000XM3. Here's my take: Design: I like the looks. They appeal to my industrial design concept that sleek and modern is not always the best. The exposed steel and wires is reminiscent of the traditional headphones. I think the style will stand the test of time. Bose and Sony are more streamlined, but the modernistic approach may appear dated in several years. Controls: I am not a Luddite, but I do not like touch control configurations. There is nothing like a physical button in increasing volume and the pause button. Even the Jabra and Jaybird wireless earbuds give tactile feedback with control. I just like buttons that I can feel and confirm, a positive click. Battery life: Not the longest but I tied it for 19 hours during one measurement. That is more than enough. The USB-C is universal, and it charges from every source I plug in. Bluetooth. There is absolutely no, none, nada, video to audio lag. When watching speaker audio and the headsets, the sound is simultaneous. Feel free to watch these with a TV and blue tooth stream. Just make certain that your Bluetooth transmitter has the most updated AptX support. When turning on the headphones, it will announce simultaneous connections to up to two Bluetooth sources. One reviewer bemoaned the fact that the announcer only identifies them as ""phone one"" or ""phone two"". I don't find this an issue. I know phone one is my TV and phone two is my cell phone. I have not measured the absolute blue tooth distance, but I can walk down a flight of stairs and go at least 30 feet without an issue. Pause: The pause when you tilt your head is annoying. When watching TV, it kept thinking I was trying to pause. I turned it off in the app. App: Not the best. After installing the App and syncing, it needed a firmware update that took 20 minutes. Then, the only way I could sync was to unpair the Bluetooth from my phone, uninstall the app, reinstall the app and re-sync. Then, everything was ok. Any changes in the app such as equalizer or ANC settings are maintained in the headset even if the phone is not synced to the headsets. I agree, the equalizer control is not intuitively easy, but it does the job and the neutral setting or default give great sound. As I noted, the setting is stored in the headset, not the phone so you don't need your phone to keep the settings. ANC; Not the best, but no intrusive. I find it great for office work and daily background noise. If you don't require absolute total isolation from a jet airplane, these will work. ANC Off: There is some isolation from the earphones. With ANC off, the sound is impressively wonderful. Crystal clear, special, dynamic. It does beat the Sony with ANC off.  I felt the Sony had too much thumping or muffled bass boost. Volume: In my opinion, louder with less distortion than the Sony or Bose. The Sony and Bose have significant base distortion on max volume Weight: The Sony seems to be lighter and easier to wear long term. I'm no a fan of the Bose fit. The Sennheiser are a little tighter than preferred when I got them out of the box. Easily fixed with some manual ""unbending"" of the band. The weight seems find for hour of listening and they feel better than the Bose. The Sony's are the best, but are also all plastic. Problems: The first pair I purchased had a ""white noise"" feedback in the left ear when place on ambient noise. It was intermittent but continued on and off each time I wore them. And, there was a crackling in the left ear. As if there was a connection issue. I returned them and the new set was perfect. Amazon returns are easy. The app is a little cumbersome on first set up. You have to install it, connect, get the firmware. Then, in my case, I had to uninstall the paring and app and reinstall to make it reconnect. However, now all is good. Initially the headband was slightly tight. It needed a little tweaking. This is not a big deal What would be ideal would be the Sony weight, the Sennheiser sound and appearance, the Bose quality and ease of support.(there are a lot of Bose stores in the mall). Since there is no single perfect headphone, like looking for the perfect laptop, there are always slight compromises. Overall: If you want Bluetooth 5 connection, great sound, good ANC and range, good battery and classic styling, go no further. Yes, they won't fold into a slim aerodynamic sandwich, but they give crystal clear sound and perfect video lip sync and can be worn for hours. Updated: As much as I liked the sound and fit, I ended up returning the headphones due to a never ending problem of bluetooth disconnects and drops. While listening to music or a streaming video, the bluetooth would drop after 20 minutes of use. The only way to reconnect was to either switch the ANC off and on or turn the headphones off and try to reconnect. I called Sennheiser and did a complete removal of all bluetooth devices on the transmitter, removed all bluetooth from my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, reconnected the bluetooth link to the transmitter, and the problem continued. Once it occured, it would drop the signal about every 10 minutes.. I have connected Jabra Active 65T, Sony SH 1000 XM3, and Jaybird Vista without any issues or drops. I removed all bluetooth connections and have no extraneous sources of interference. Sennheiser told me that the bluetooth in the headphones was not acting correctly and they should be returned. So, first set had a faulty left speaker. The second set had faulty bluetooth. Maybe it was bad luck....I loved the sound, the weight, the fit, the appearance. I just am left disappointed in the quality of the device.  If you get a working model, they are great.",3.0
"Price - Both are currently $399USD at the time of this review. Design - I slightly prefer the looks of the Bose while on my head. It’s more streamlined and minimalistic. The Sennheiser’s look more elegant with the steel and leather materials when off the head or when on the head from a side view. However, the exposed wiring looks kinda funky on the head from a front view (hence why none of the promo pics show the model wearing these headphones from a front view. They’re always looking towards the side.) Both are built well with no worries that one will break easily from normal usage. The Momentum’s takes the slight edge here in overall build quality because of the authentic leather on the ear-pads and headband. The Bose can fold flat which results in a much smaller profile when stowed away in its hard shell carrying case. The Sennheiser’s can also fold, but not flat. Sennheiser’s carrying case is about twice the thickness of the Bose and it’s not a hard shell material so the Sennheiser’s face a higher chance of crush damage while being in your bag. Controls - Bose went with touch controls while Sennheiser retained the tried and true button configurations. Both headphones allow controls of your volume, play and pause media and call accept, hang up and hold. Both thankfully have a dedicated voice assistant button however, the Bose allows for always on and listening Alexa. Both can toggle between ANC modes, but the Bose allows for 3 different ANC preset switching out of the 11 different options while the Sennheiser’s allow for only ANC on or off and ambient mode. The Bose surprisingly doesn’t allow you to turn off the ANC from the headphone. In order to turn off the ANC on the Bose, you have to do that from the app. The touch controls on the Bose is pretty responsive and I don’t really have issues with it. Time will tell if they suffer the same fate with random triggers and inputs when in cold temperatures like the Sony WH1000Xm3. The button controls on the Sennheiser’s is tactile and works as it should. So it really depends if you prefer buttons or touch controls here. Comfort - I prefer the Sennheiser slightly here. It’s lighter and just hugs my head with enough pressure to not fall off with any sudden head movements. The ear-pads opening is generous and allows my ears to go in all the way and not be clamped down. The Bose is quite comfortable but they clamp a little harder on my head. I can wear both for 2 hours straight but the Sennheiser’s just leaves my head not feeling as fatigued. Battery Life - Bose takes the cake here. Longer 20 hour battery vs. the Sennheiser’s 17 hours. Also, from a quick 10 minute charge the Bose can receive a longer charge at 3 hours vs the Sennheiser’s 1.5 hours. Both charge via USB-C. Bluetooth - Sennheiser’s take the cake here in terms of codec support. NFC support is on the Sennheiser’s but not the Bose. Sennheiser also support AptX-LL which is great for those who might want to play video games if they have a AptX-LL equipped receiver or device. In terms of YouTube, Netflix and Hulu, I haven’t detected any lip sync issues while watching videos on either pair of headphones. Both support AAC and SBC, but the Bose does not support AptX. Connectivity and range has been pretty great on both and I haven’t had any crazy issues while using both on the bus, subway, walking through NYC, at the office and at home. Both support 2 device connections simultaneously. I prefer the Bose implementation because it switches between devices more seamlessly in my experience and the voice prompts tells you the name of the device it is connected to or has disconnected from. The Sennheiser’s voice prompt just says “phone 1 connected/disconnected” or “phone 2 connected/disconnected” which isn’t really helpful if you’re like me and have a desk with a MacBook Pro, iPad Pro and iPhone XS Max on it. Both can conveniently be put into pairing mode from one of the buttons on the control side of the headphone’s ear-cups. Call quality - Bose is still number 1 here. Callers continue to tell me they can hear my clearly despite me being right next to a bus engine on my commute to work. Meanwhile on the Sennheiser’s, callers said they can hear the bus engine and I need to speaker up louder in the same environment, but they can still hear me unlike the Sony WH1000Xm3 which is completely horrible in these situations. Both perform exceptionally well when giving commands to Siri or Google Assistant. If you’re in a quiet to moderately loud environment, they’re both gonna do well in calls. The Bose just sets itself apart in noisy environments due to the excellent microphone array and the ability to cancel out background noises. Both have a convenient feature to mute your microphone while on the call using the voice control button on the Bose and the volume down button on the Sennheiser’s. Features - Both do the basics for a 2019 premium ANC headphone. Bose has significantly more control over its ANC system (albeit a bit overkill). The Bose has 11 presets with 0 being ambient aware mode and 10 being maximum noise cancelling. Also, on the Bose there’s a button to toggle between 3 saved ANC presets from the app which leverages on the fly adaptation to your environment. Sennheiser’s approach is to either have the ANC on at max intensity or on with wind reduction or lower cabin pressure, ANC off or transparency/ambient mode with the ability to have audio play as well or not. The ambient mode is slightly superior on the Bose. The Bose makes your ambient environment sound like you don’t have headphones on and it comes off as very natural. The Sennheiser’s sound slightly digital but very good nonetheless. As for noise cancelling, Bose is easily superior in terms of suppressing the noises around you. With the Sennheiser’s, I can still hear a decent amount of what’s going on around me while I’m commuting or walking through the city. With the Bose, the world literally melts away when the noise canceling is engaged and I can faintly hear what’s going on around me. When music is playing for the most part they will both block out everything around you typical in a commuting situation unless you listen at low volumes or there’s a quiet passage in the music or media in which the Sennheiser’s weaker ANC will cause loud outside noise to seep in. Sound - I enjoy listening to both. The device I used is my MacBook Pro streaming AptX to the Sennheiser’s and AAC to the Bose. The Sennheiser is the more bass heavy, richer, spacious and warmer sounding of the two. The Bose is very balanced and neutral to my ears. Very high levels of clarity and detail can be heard on both sets, but the Sennheiser’s slightly edges the Bose in immediate detail and clarity. Soundstage is superior on the Sennheiser’s whereas everything just has this multidimensional and spacious presentation. The music sounds more like a live performance on Sennheiser’s as opposed to listening in a studio like on the Bose. The separation of the instruments within the music is great on both, but the Bose sounds more dynamically compressed in comparison to the Sennheiser. The superior dynamics of the Sennheiser’s aides in the ability to replicate a more convincing sense of space between instruments. The Sennheiser’s bass is very powerful and well extended. It’s a healthy bass boost but it is centered in the sub-bass region which mitigates bass bleed into the midrange. The Bose has a more neutral bass that can bottom out and distort when pushed to high volumes. The Sony WH1000Xm3 in comparison has a bass boost mostly in the upper and mid bass which blooms over into the mids and makes them sound boomy overall. The Sennheiser’s get louder than the Bose and Sony’s and don’t distort at max volume which is a plus if you like to listen at those volumes. The Bose and Sony’s at max volume can distort on some tracks regardless if ANC is on or off. No, I don’t believe in burn-in (If you’re getting ready to say I didn’t have the Sennheiser’s long enough). I’ve listened to countless brand new headphones and a highly used one of the same model and they always sound and measure the exact same. Conclusion - The Sennheiser’s have a special spot in my collection even though compared to the Bose, It performs worse overall in ANC performance, isn’t as comfortable to my head, has a worse overall battery performance, looks elegant but a bit uglier in my opinion than the streamlined look of the Bose, doesn’t perform as well for calls, has less overall controllability from the headphones and it’s bulkier to carry around due to the much larger case that provides less protection than the Bose. Why? Because despite all that it still does the essentials required from a modern day 2019 pair of ANC wireless headphones all while packing the best sound experience in this category to my ears. Great job Sennheiser. You’ve managed to incorporate a better microphone for voice pickup and 2 device Bluetooth connectivity (something the overrated Sony WH1000Xm3 couldn’t do), a decent and controllable ANC with ambient modes and good comfort alongside your signature sound. Color me impressed!",4.0
"I'm really bummed out about these. As soon as they were released, I ordered a pair. Build quality is top notch. Sound was really nice until I started hearing popping noises. Battery was stuck at 60% after being plugged in over night. The leather on the right earpad was scarred right out of the box. Too many issues for a $400 dollar pair of headphones. I ended up returning these. Hopefully they will iron out the kinks in the future. Until then I will still be searching for the ultimate headphones.",2.0
"To give some perspective, I’m the type of consumer who owns a collection of various headphone types from the Shure SE 215 to the SE846 to the legendary Sony MDR-XB90EX. I have the Bose QC35s, beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, a few Etymotic Research and Grados for critical listening and a Sennheiser HD 650. I like music a lot as it is what grounds me. Nevertheless these Sennheiser Momentum‘s sounded amazing and were loud for Bluetooth headphones but their design and features cripple them. Call quality is not good. It’s a step above terrible which isn’t saying much. The software and EQ is terrible to use. It’s not intuitive and prevents the user from granular controls. Each edit affects multiple frequencies which makes the app just provoking to use. Noise Canceling is terrible, mediocre at best. Comfort is lacking (at least for me) these are heavy and you start to notice the weight after some time. Mechanics of adjusting the headband is terrible and I found myself continuously making micro adjustments as the position I set them to often changes while moving around. The two biggest Annoyances was the auto pause and turning off the headphones. Auto paused enables itself if you tilt your head down. So while I was looking down on my phone or reading a book this feature would trigger on and off causing me to just turn it off completely. Second was the stupidest method ever conceived by mankind in turning a Bluetooth headphone off or on. This requires that you always fold the headphone in a very specific manner and pray that it remains folded while being transported without the case. The Problem with this is that most people do not intentionally fold their headphones when taking it off their heads to place on top of their desk. It’s just not intuitive and this was the last issue that caused me to return these. Maybe next time they will make an awesome set of headphones with out the gimmicks or tricks. I just want something that sounds like the Momentum’s with the comfort and the simplicity of the Bose QC35s. Sennheiser, look up the word simplicity and functional please.",2.0
"Noise cancelling is not strong with these headphones. The sound though.  Amazing.  Nope, better than that.  Songs I've heard my entire life sound like completely new songs. Everything sounds good.  Rock, pop, country, classical. Rap isn't music, so...ask someone else.  All frequencies are clear.  Not enough bass to vibrate off your noggin but enough to make you smile.  Mids and highs are perfect.  I tried the EQ in the free app for these and put it back to stock.  No adjustments needed. If you need something for your flight, buy the Sonys or Bose.  If you're in an office, coffee shop, or at home, buy these. Also, the case sucks.  It's not hard or very protective.  The headphones can turn themselves on there's so much extra space. Buy a new case if you're taking them anywhere.",5.0
"Was comparing this to Bose NC 700, and the Momentum 3's clearly sounded better, especially in the sub-bass range.  I've heard Sony XM3s, Bose 700, and Momentum 3.  This is the best sounding one among the three! Potential safety hazard: the joint of the folding mechanism is very sharp. While unfolding for the first time, it nipped my hand and it was very painful!  Wasn't expecting to shed blood while operating a pair of headphones, but that's actually what happened.  Definitely be careful while unfolding these, they ""bite""!",4.0
"Ordered a pair as soon as it was available, at the beginning, I liked it a-lot! In general this is a great pair of headphones with 2 major flaws. I will start with good - Sound is good, not amazing but definitely will please most mainstream consumers (not sure the price is mainstream though..)  Build quality is amazing, the leather on the ear caps is so soft! features are in line with the time of the release, didn't find anything missing except one major feature - on/off switch, but more about this in cons. Now to the reasons I returned these. 1. Bluetooth connectivity with Android devices, for some reason, i had constant disconnections and drops when connected to my Galaxy S10+, even after disabling the auto pause function to be sure it is not a sensor sensitivity issue. but it kept disconnecting for a few seconds and then connecting back. I connected my B&O to the same phone and had a very stable connection, reboot everything and connected the Momentum, the problem came back right away. This didn't happen at all when connected to my Ipad, it did not disconnect or skipped a bit. 2. The lack of on/of switch and no Stand By option, as a frequent flier, I move through the airports an in many cases with the headphones around my neck, this is a problem with the Momentum's as it keeps the headphones on and keep draining the battery when you are not actually using the headphones to listen to music or as an ANC set, to switch it off, you have to fold this set and to be honest with this huge and flimsy carrying case it is just basic inconvenience absolutely unnecessary due to exclusion of the on/off switch for the gimmicky fold/unfold mechanism in my opinion. One last thing to mention, the looks of the headsets on the smaller heads, when the metal holding arms extend below the bottom of the earcups, make it look as a bad fit for the otherwise gorgeously designed piece of tech!  but this is very subjective.",3.0
"I have tried what I’d thought were all the supposedly “best in class” headphones in the $3-450 dollar range over the past several years beginning with some Bose Noise Canceling which got me hooked on this compulsion to have the best headphones I can reasonably afford. I’ve figured I spend such an amount of time using them for many purposes, not just music, but on the daily metro commute, it’s nice to drown out the crazy and be in whatever world you chose for the day. I also usually have most of the workday available to use them whenever I’m at my desk or working solo. I’ve used the Q35 Quiet Comforts which at the time I loved, I think I actually wore out the ear pads on those over two years. That gave me the excuse to “treat myself” and I had a great time trying every quality set of headphones I could get my hands on. I wanted to avoid going over 400, but would have for the right ones. First, I had the Sony XM whatever they’re called - the ones known for best ANC. I Never personally felt the ANC was any different whatsoever from the Bose, and the Bose actually had a cleaner sound as if it played it precisely how it was produced and meant to be heard. Sony was good, but it sounded muffled and too much bass. I’m not in high school I don’t want to “bump” or whatever they’re calling it these stupid days 🙄 Regardless, the “bump” sounded muffled and, I’ll use an audiophile word that comes to mind, makes for a smaller, more narrow “soundstage”. When I heard that critique I absolutely knew what they’d meant. Okay, I digressed a bit but point is, I’ve tried a lot of great and well regarded headphones. My last two pairs were first Beoplay H9I’s which I sold soon after for comfort issues and ended up with Bose 700C which I’ve been using, unenthusiastically for the past 8 months or so waiting until it would be forgivable to blow the money once again on high end headphones instead of feeding the elderly and infirm or something magnanimous like that. I finally got my chance to blow that idea off completely and start anew in my search for the most perfect wireless, ANC, over ear headphones I could afford. I thought I’d have to look quite a while as I did when I was back and forth with Sony and Beoplay among others; I found these fairly quickly and from my previous experiences I had a pretty good feeling about them. I read a few independent reviews where often the sonys and 700s were rated above these Momentum’s, but which also concluded these headphones had the best overall sound quality. Isn’t that the point? The others won for amazing ANC (it was good, i wouldn’t be able to tell the ANC in those from the ANC in the Momentum’s. I’m not an audiophile. The difference has to be so minor it’s undetectable by a human ear owned by someone who’s not a pretentious complainer:) I’ve left reviews here and there when products really deserve it or the service but it’s by no means a routine. And doing so with as much confidence that all those reading this who are on the fence will thank me - maybe tight here in the comments. If it turns out to be resentment, still, please come and say “hi”:) For science. Or something. I’ve listened to a bit of hip hop, 90s rock and roll, classical music (moonlight sonata and chopin’s nocturne 9 or something like that), classic rock, oldies, Motown, folk music, and I’ve tested out audiobooks and spoken word to get the EQ on the companion app set up ready to go. It took a few minutes to feel pretty satisfied with how each of them turned out but there are also tips online to be found. Not only are these the absolute best quality headphones I’ve ever heard in my lifetime (even a call home to my mother, the sound was Phenomenally clear as on no device I’d ever used before.  She mentioned the same on her end, she hates when I use my airpods apparently they’re not fun to listen to. But these were perfect for both sides. The music was striking. I rarely just listen to music sitting in a chair but after I had these on a while and home for the night, I’ve had them on since looking for everything and anything to show me just how awesome these are. So far they seem like these, right here, are the most perfectly sounding, fitting, intuitive, and also majorly importantly, perhaps even the most comfortable I’ve tried, and I’m not kidding. They fold and shut down auto, then start up auto when unfolded. Auto Pause when you lift the cups off your ears or put around the neck. The materials are as good as the rest of these things. Sheep’s skin leather, so comfortable and exuding quality. The steel frames above the head with padding have like an old school industry producer look and look totally cool. They are rather large which makes for noticeably better sound AND comfort - but it could be said that it looks kinda stupid. Hahaa. I’m trying not to be self conscious but at least day one I haven’t succeeded as of yet. Regardless, I mean it when I say these actually are great enough to keep whether I look stupid in them or not. A, not small price, but maybe regretfully necessary price to pay? You decide. p.s. I added a profile selfie to give an idea how they look on the ole noggin. Maybe I'm biased, but I don't find them completely aesthetically challenged as i'd maybe implied... Still, the Bose, Beoplay, etc make theirs look good enough, in a sense, they become a fashion accessory in and of themselves. I don't buy headphones for fashion, so idgas, but i know many would. p.s.. p.s. I live in the Seattle Area with infinite numbers of mask nazi's, so if you're somewhere normal, just shut it.",5.0
"Summary: the Momentum 3s sound great and are well built. Fantastic for music, and good enough for calls. Sound quality: This is the reason to splurge for the Momentum 3s. Great, full-range, tight bass, clear mids and highs. Make sure you've enabled aptX and the maximum bitrate for AAC (search online for instructions on Mac and Android). If you install the Sennheiser app, you can change equalizer settings, like if you want Beats-level bass boost. After playing around, I decided I like the default sound best. Video: Sounds great. I've experienced no lag with Netflix, YouTube, or Prime Video. Comfort: Like all over-ear headphones, these can get a little warm. Fine for me. They're also heavier than the all-plastic Bose 700 and Sony XM3, because the Momentum 3s are built with real metal and leather. Weight is similar to the B&W PX7 and B&O H9. I find it ok, and worth it for the sound quality. Bluetooth: They pair with 2 devices concurrently for audio, and I have them paired with 3 devices in total (MacBook, iPad, and Android phone). Switching works fine. Controls: They have physical buttons that you learn to find by touch. I find them more reliable and less finicky than touch gestures. (The H9 touch controls didn't work for me at all.) The setting to auto-mute when you remove from your head just didn't work properly for me though. It would mute and unmute if I nodded my head. I turned off the setting, and don't miss it. Not a big deal. The transparency mode is easy to activate with a switch. Some reviewers complain about how you have to fold them to turn them off. I find it no big deal -- it's easy to see that they're folded and off, vs not being sure if the little red light is on. Build quality: High quality. Solid. Real metal and leather. Downside: they're a little heavier than all-plastic cans like Bose and Sony. I pinched myself with the metal when unfolding them. I can deal. Case construction: Nice round case, looks high end. It's soft, not hard. It's small enough for my carry on bag and commuter bag. It includes a pocket for a cable in case your battery runs down. Works for me. Call quality: Sound is great when other people are speaking. At first, I found them pretty awkward for calls, due to the lack of sidetone (hearing your own voice), and would have recommended them only for occasional calls, not if you make lots of video and phone calls. Then I discovered that the app has a setting to give you sidetone! Turn on Transparency mode, and check the box to play music at the same time. Now you can hear the outside world, including your own voice, so you know you're not shouting. Problem solved! Noise cancellation: Not the main reason why I bought them. This is a bonus feature for me. It helps with public transit and plane noise, and definitely gets the level down enough to make the music or video sound enjoyable. If your #1 goal is noise cancellation, Bose or Sony is probably what you want. Design: It's subjective. I like the look better than all but the Bang & Olufsen H9s. The white + brown version of the M3s is stylish, though I went with the black. Conclusion: After extensively researching the options in this price range, and trying multiple headphones, this is the pair I'm keeping. For my personal preferences, these are a winner.",4.0
"I will compare these to the Bose 700s and Sony XM3s at the end if you’re interested, for now a Momentum 3 review. DESIGN: These headphones are very sturdy, they feel like a pair of $400 headphones. No squeaking or sliding around. I feel I can safely put these on my backpack without a case and they will be just fine. APP, BLUETOOTH and EASE OF USE: All you have to do to use the headphones is unfold them and they go into pairing mode, then simply connect to your phone which will ask you to download the Sennheiser app. Within the app you can change the Noise cancelling between Max, Anti Wind which is just a lower noice cancelling setting, and anti pressure which supposedly reduces the pressure feeling from noice cancelling however I found no difference between max and anti pressure. There is no difference in sound quality either between any of the modes as far as I can tell. You can also turn off noise cancelling altogether and still get the same sound quality. There is an option called transparent hearing which allows you to hear people’s voices more clearly at the cost of some sound quality, this is useful when walking around the street I suppose. Lastly there is an Equalizer (EQ) that allows you to adjust the Bass and Trebble which in terms also affects the mids. Its confusing to use and to be honest I prefer the stock setting best. I haven’t had any issues with the headphones disconnecting, cutting in and out, or not connecting to the app. NOISE CANCELLING: Noise cancelling is ok, I would say it can block out road noise, and most chatter if you turn the volume up enough. However this will not give you complete silence. Its more of a thing to help you focus on your music. I ran a small test by putting coffee shop noise on my tv which measured at 85dB. Any louder and you can start to notice the noise. I found it quite surprising that the ANC on these headphones is only a tiny bit better than the one on my Sennheiser 4.50 headphones which are 1/4 the price. SOUND: This is where these headphones shine. Their sound is crystal clear, the BASS packs a punch which doesn't distort the music or instruments. It doesn't drown out the mids or the vocals. The mids and the highs are also very balanced, it sounds beautiful is the best way I can describe it haha. Some headphones have such bad sound that singing almost becomes a high pitched noise, with the momentums it feels as if someone is singing to you... while musical instruments play along with that voice. With other headphones it just sounds like a bunch of noise clustered together where you cant even tell what instruments are playing and it just sounds like a beat. MOVIES: The bass from music translates nicely to media. Explosions, car chases, etc all have a punch to them in movies. I can’t think of a better headphone to listen to movies. The momentum 3s enhance your experience as opposed to just letting you listen to what is going on. Also the EQ can be adjusted with as much bass and treble you want and it will save to the headphone itself. So if you connect these via aux to the TV they will keep the EQ. COMFORT: I left comfort for last because its the biggest downfall at least in my opinion and is the only reason for these headphones getting 4 stars. They are big, bulky, heavy, and you will noice you’re wearing them. These aren’t the headphones you want to walk around with, or take on a flight, or use to study. These headphones are for when you want to enjoy music for 1-2 hours at a time. The metal headband is kind of a pain to adjust, it requires both hands, my hands touching/sliding against the metal bands is kind of concerning as it feels as if Im going to cut myself even though its just a feeling and I doubt its possible. I wish it was covered so It could also have a stealthier look that doesn’t stand out. Simple is better for some. Clamping force is also pretty strong to the point where I have to take them off to rest my ears and my jaw. Are these worth the $400? Well in my opinion they’re not... why? Because they are uncomfortable. If Im paying $400 for headphones I want to be able to wear them whenever, however long. I want to be able to take them on a walk, to chill in the couch with them, and to use them for movies. It doesn’t matter how good they sound or feel if I can’t wear them for 5+ hours at a time. Sennheiser Momentum 3 vs Bose 700 vs Sony WF1000XM3 If the sennheiser were more comfortable, and looked like a more normal pair of headphone, i wouldn't even need to write anything here. I would say run out and buy them. However each headphone has their pros and cons. If you see the term “cabin pressure” it refers to that weird feeling you get when you try ANC Headhones. That underwater feeling. Bose 700: these have the most neutral sound, they have the least bass out of all three and are also the least loudest. Even with their ANC being almost double the sennheiser I still have to increase the volume to 80% even on a quiet room. They are also the least “fun” to listen too because they sound so flat. However, because of their flat sound signature they sound very accurate and no bass, high, mid is overdone. They are good. In terms of comfort the headphones themselves are comfortable but their ANC gives you that small cabin pressure feeling. Sony xm3: these have alot of bass but its not the good kind of bass. Its the kind of bass that becomes muffled and distorted. These are by far the least accurate headphones from all 3. Their instrument separation is also bad, there are some instruments you wont even be able to hear with these unless you adjust their eq. However they are more fun to use than the Bose 700s and you will only notice their distortion if you pay close attention. These are also the most comfortable pair of headphones i’ve ever worn. It feels like you’re not even wearing anything. I have worn these for 15 hours at a time. I can fall asleep with them, walk with them, etc. They basically dont exist on my ears. They also have very little to no cabin pressure. Momentum 3: these sound the best out of the 3. If you take the Sonys “fun” factor and the Boses accuracy you get the mometum 3s. However they’re uncomfortable to wear which is the biggest downfall. The headband has very little padding which becomes bothersome, the ear ups are also super stiff. Their cabin pressure is less than the bose 700s though. In the end if you’re spending $400 because you want the ultimate headphone for music, movies, and everything sound get the sony xm3. If you want a “stay at home” headphone get the momentum 3s. If you will only use your headphones for music and you want to use them for long periods of time get the Bose 700s.",5
Very disappointed.  Sound quality is no better than my 10 y/o daughters $20 Bluetooth headphones.  So many flaws.  Muddy bass.  Lack of voice & instrument clarity.  Sounds such as symbols in the background (even with adjusting eq).  Headphone were connected to my wife’s phone— she wanted to try them.  I then connected to my phone.  The headphones kept wanting to connect her phone instead of mine despite being assigned to my phone.  I could listen to he phone calls while she’s on the phone despite clearly intending to connect to my phone.  Positives— Alexa.  The fit was good finish good.  They are heavy.— by that— not well balanced.  The weight is in the headband portion of the gear and not the ear cups therefore the weight is more noticeable  PX7’s the weight is in the ear cups and therefore more balanced.  The weight is not noticeable.  Sound isolation perform equally as well.  No EQ with PX7 but not needed— they are well tuned.  The bass is not punchy but appropriate.  Boosting bass would not be accurate. If gadgetry such as Alexa is you thing then I’d say look for a cheaper headphone with Alexa.  Seinnhauser needs to redesign these cans — they are not worth the retail price.,3
"I purchased these headphones for computer use. These headphones come with a feature turned on by DEFAULT that is SUPPOSED to pause music or audio when you take them off apparently. Unfortunately this feature is poorly implemented, it will permanently mute discord and games and will require a restart. (I would feel sorry for anyone trying to use these in any professional application) All I wanted was a decent pair of wireless headphones that weren't ""MaDe FoR GaMeRs"". I know this feature can bee disabled from a MOBILE APP - that can be put back straight where it came from. Another fun fact these headphones come with a 2.5 to 3.5 mm cable (why even use 2.5 mm in the first place, what is wrong with you?!) in order to use these headphones the old school way, (Using the Headphones this way will still drain the battery, so whats the point?) BUT they are proprietary which will cost about $11 for a replacement. (O.E is not available on amazon btw, only knock offs) Tl;Dr Do not buy this for desktop applications. If you're really looking for $300 headphones for on the go applications that might get lost or stolen this might be what you're looking for. (please no) Audio Quality - 8/10 Build Quality - 8/10 Noise Cancellation - 10/10 Usability - Squirrel stuck in a tailpipe/10",1
"I use these at the gym. Every time a dumbbell approaches my head the Bluetooth disconnects. I ordered a replacement pair, updated the software, still the same problem. Even on the treadmill they go on and off. I own the previous model which has none of these problems. Yes, the sound is improved but functionality is gone. Also why the indicator light for noise cancellation is in the back? If in front, I could check in a mirror. Because sometimes after the Bluetooth disconnects ANC also turns off. Update: after turning “smart pause “ now they are usable and merit 4 stars.",1
"I ordered this set as well as a pair of Beyerdynamic Amion Wireless headphones to compare against each other.  After a considerable period of online research and review-reading, I had narrowed my choices down to these two.  Honestly, it wasn't even close.  The Sennheisers sound far better, fit better, have better BT connectivity and are MUCH cheaper.  The Amions, while good, were certainly not good enough to justify the almost $600 price tag.  If they were priced at closer to $200, then sure.  I will say that I haven't yet had a chance to deal with all of the various and sundry buttons on the Sennheisers, or use them on a phone call (but my main use for these will be at work, so I don't anticipate taking calls while wearing them), so I can't attest to those aspects--and I absolutely refuse to use the noise cancellation, so I am very happy that I can turn it off with a switch, rather than needing a software function through an app, like the Bose QC line.  Sound quality is the number one variable for me and using noise cancellation is like trying to listen to music through two bowls of pea soup.  Now, as the headline suggests, the sonic quality of these is excellent--especially considering these are BT headphones--but I will say that the overall character of the sound is a wee bit too warm for my taste.  It's not mushy--there is good detail and punch--but these were definitely designed to appeal to a more consumer-friendly ear (because consumers have been taught over the past 30 years that tons of bass is more important than overall sound quality).  Fortunately, for me, that's not enough of a problem to overcome all of the positives with this product.  I plan to use the Sennheiser app just long enough to adjust the EQ on the headset, and then I'm done with it.  If Sennheiser wants my data, they can buy it from me, not Hoover it out of my phone for free.",4
"I've had these headphones for over a year and overall I will say I'm mostly pleased with them. Battery life has never been an issue. Sound quality over a stable/performant Bluetooth connection has been excellent. Had a number of firmware issues for the longest time including one where the headphones very frequently refused to reconnect to my phone pending an authorization workflow (very odd/paranoid security measure), among other things. They have all been pretty much resolved for a few months now, but IMO it was a shoddy product release at best. One thing that has never been fixed is the terrible aptX LL (Low Latency) performance. I purchased no less than 5 Bluetooth 5.0 transmitters which I had connected to my living room TV always trying to fix a frequent pop/crackle sound coming from the headphones whenever I watched movies or played videogames. I narrowed the issue down to LL because with a non LL connection (on my Samsung Note 10+, for example) the performance was always top-notch and sound was clean. The connection there would've been either SBC, aptX (baseline), or AAC. I was convinced the issue was with the Bluetooth transmitters. I figured they weren't providing a stable enough connection for the headphones. The last one I purchased was quite expensive (around $70-$80) and had all the bells and whistles including long range capabilities. Still no go. Finally, one day I paired two of those transmitters (one in RX mode) and once an aptX LL connection was established I connected the RX one to my Momentums via a 2.5mm audio cable and voilà! No pops and no crackles. This is how I have been using the headphones for the last couple of days. Pretty disappointed in this regard.",3
"These are simply awesome cans! I owe a pair of Sony WH1000XM3's which are a superb device. I think Sony is to be complimented for their recent production of some world class products, stepping clearly out in front of the simply good mass produced electronics that they are noted for. That being said, these Sennheiser Momentum 3 are just a bit sweeter, a bit more distinct and sharp in the upper range. It's kind of a wasteful, delicious indulgence to own several different cans to experience their unique performance. As a baby boomer (easy haters) I've probably blowed out most of my fine range hearing having experienced first hand the finest rock music ever produced in the history the world  in the 60's, 70's and 80's (go ahead, I double dare you to say differently)! These Sennheiser's rock the Zep, the Stones, Pink Floyd and yes Leonard Cohen the way it was met to be! Give them a shot..you won't be disappointed!",5
"June 2020 (purchased these November 2019). Would I buy these again? Yes. Sound quality and build quality are great. ANC is okay -- not best-in-class, but that wasn't my priority with these. Comfort: I wear glasses and have long hair. No issue with these and glasses (thin frames), but hair needs to be tied up, otherwise it gets instantly caught in the sliders. I can wear these for ~5 hours straight. More than that and the tips of my ears start to hurt/they weigh on my head too much. I've worn then more (closer to the 5 hours) because my SO and I are both WFH due to COVID, but usually I'd only wear them a couple hours at a time. Intermittent issues with Bluetooth and my work computer (MacBook Pro). Ie, works perfectly for weeks at a time, then I'll randomly have to power cycle/re-pair/etc. No issues with connecting to my phone (Pixel 3) at all though. Battery life isn't actually that much of a negative. I charge them overnight occasionally, and have only run out of battery once. Plugged them in to my computer and continued to use them while they charged. --- Only issues: Relatively short battery life, as compared to other similar headphones. I haven't really had issues with battery life though -- generally just plug them in after work and they're obviously fully charged the next morning. Will only charge with included cable... My phone and work computer both charge with usb-c, so I thought it would be convenient to have headphones that also charged with a usb-c cord. Well, these headphones input seem to charge with the included cable. Any wall plug is fine though. I've had some issues connecting via bluetooth to my work computer (2016 Macbook Pro). Usually this is seamless and doesn't require me to do anything but sometimes I'll have to manually click ""connect"" in the Bluetooth options. Terrible first world problem, I know. Last dislike: these are pretty expensive, honestly. But you get what you pay for, and I wanted headphones that would last me a long time. -------- Overall, sound quality is good, noise cancelling is good (don't expect 110% silence though, from these or any other headphones), transparent hearing is actually a really cool feature, and being about to connect to multiple devices fairly seamlessly without an app is really nice. I picked these over the sony and bose headphones these are often compared against because my priorities were build and sound quality. ANC and battery life were important, but ultimately things that mattered less to me than build/sound quality. I use these for work and gaming. I work from home, but travel in to the office frequently. These fit my needs really well.",5
"I think this is a superior alternative to the popular ANC headphone brands (Sony, Bose, Beats), as the sound quality is on another level. The Sony 1000Xm4's don't sound bad by any means, but these have so much more track separation and nuance. This becomes immediately apparent when you're listening to music with multiple layers. Bass resonates deep and is clear. The highs sparkle. The mids are recessed a bit but lush, giving you a warm, clear sound all the way through. Easy to listen to for hours. I LOVE these! The earcups are also rather roomy. My ears don't touch anything at all. However, the bottom of the ear cushion has just a bit too much force against my head, and my head is on the narrow side. It's not uncomfortable though. ANC is pretty effective. Not as much as the Sony 1000Xm4's, but it's on the upper end of things. IMO the volume buttons on the right earcup are too similar. It's hard to tell if you're pressing the pause button or the volume button. You eventually learn which is which though, and you can feel around to figure it out. It would help if Sennheiser gave the middle button a different texture or elevation. Shouldn't be that hard of an R&D fix. There's 2 things I really don't like about this product: 1. The carrying case is trash for headphones this expensive. The top and bottom are hard shelled, but it's a compressible case, so I wouldn't completely trust it to protect the headphones. It's a good thing they have exceptional build quality. 2. The headphones automatically turn on and off by opening and closing the headphones. I think this is stupid. If I want to wear the headphones around my neck while they're off. I should be able to. Sennheiser should have put on a power button and made the auto-on/off feature optional through the app. Overall though, these are amazing. Even at the original retail price of $400, I would consider these to be pretty good, but at $277 here, it's no question. They're worth it, for sure. I think they're better quality headphones than the Sony 1000X m4 and the Bose NC 700's due to superior sound and build quality. They're headphones after all. Audio is the reason we use them in the first place.",5
"When I bought this headphones. Went to compare in Apple Store with Bose 700, and what I can say about this 2 headphones. On Bose better design, battery life, noise cancellation, microphone, but terrible sound quality. On Sennheiser more colorful and strong sound, on Bose sound is very thick and compressed. If for you sound on first place - buy Sennheiser.",5
"I had the previous gen momentums, and was initially pleased with this upgrade. Over time, I found them to be almost useless because they would constantly pause my media. Attempts to turn this off with their broken mobile app failed for weeks, until I was finally able to get them to connect last night. Once I upgraded the firmware to 3.x and turned off the auto-pause feature, these headphones became usable. If you love the sound but hate the functionality, try and get an upgrade installed before sending them back. I'm leaving this review at 3 stars due to the headache I had to go through to make these not work like cheap garbage.",3
"AbsolutelyiIncredible sound, the best of any cordless cans I've tried yet.  Noise cancelling was also great, open windows with lawn mowers going and wife/kids in the background were completely cancelled for me as well as other people on my calls.  The depth of the cans was a bit shallow though and after an hour or two led to a bit of a claustrophobic feeling. The connectivity issues are what really kill this as a product.  I constantly fought the bluetooth drivers and had to repeatedly uninstall/reinstall/reboot to keep the headphones connected.  Also for some reason these showed up as two different audio devices in Windows, one being the incredible sound (only for music) and the other being a flat distant sound stage that was applied during calls.  In the end I started using them with the cord, which defeats the purpose of paying for wireless APTx headphones, so I returned them.",3
"I had the prior generation of these, the Momentum 2 which I used for years on planes and absolutely loved. The sound was amazing, comfort amazing, and could reasonably use as a phone headset. I lost my M2's on a plane, so I started looking for the successor, comparing to Bose 700, Sony 1000. In the store, the Momentums won. I simply prefer the clarity and tight bass of these headphones, the difference in audio quality is clear as day to me. But, two issues made me return them for the Sony's. As others mention, the auto-off is poorly designed. If I turned my head to the right, the headset would pause music. I updated the firmware, updated the app, tried to turn off the feature and it simply never went away. It consistently turned off music when turning my head to the right no matter what I did. The other flaw is that they are actually significantly bigger than the M2's when folded, which is a difficult achievement. They are so fat, they didn't fit in my backpack. Twice as fat as the Sony when folded. The glitch seems like such an obvious flaw I can't believe that Sennheiser let this out the door. And they really should understand that many customers pack headphones in bags, and might want them a bit more compact. Anyway, I'm happy with the Sony headphones at this point.",3
"Bought this item with international shipping (with 30% shipping costs + tax). It arrived in time, but did not work out of the box. Left earpiece produced no noise cancelling, no sound. Hardware reset and new firmware did not change it. Working with the audio cable produced no sound on several devices. Ear clamping pressure is higher, higher than at the Sony XM3. Very uncomfortable, especially, if you were eyeglasses. US Sennheiser support did not answer at all! Q&A can be bad sometimes - even for a premium price, but here the story begins: sending it back needed unbelievable paperwork (battery specs and magnet specs for air transport - which Sennheiser did not provide on request) and was costing 120 USD - including (re)export tax and shipping (!). This was the cheapest offer from all of the well-known companies. Amazon did a refund of the purchase price (thanks). Unfortunately I had to cover the 126 USD reshipping costs,  several days of paperwork and driving to multiple parcel outlets for an out-of-the-box defective product. Thanks Sennheiser for an expensive lesson and zero service. The most disappointing purchase in my amazon history. Never again.",1
"Was looking for a good bluetooth headset with aptX LL so I could use it for watching TV without any lip-sync delay.  I was surprised how hard it was to find a nice headset from a reputable manufacturer that actually has aptX LL.  Apparently Sony and Bose don't have any headphones that support this.  Anyway, I found the Momentum 3 and really liked the design.  I think it's one of the nicest looking headsets and has a good build quality with a little more metal and a little less plastic than many of the other designs out there.  Also, the earpads and headband use a really nice leather leather which adds to the high quality look and feel. Pros: - Supports aptX LL for TV listening without any lip-sync delay. - Nice build quality and good looks. - Good sound. - Bluetooth 5.0 when a lot of other headsets out there are still using the older version 4.2. - Supports Tile to help you find your headphones. - Supports Alexa. - Noise cancelling seems to work pretty well. - App is nice although somewhat light on features.  At least it has an EQ function but it is only 3-band. - USB-C charging. Neutral: - Auto-pause.  I found this annoying but luckily there is an option to turn it off so, no harm no foul. Cons: - Auto power on/off - This is done by unfolding and folding the headphones which I found rather gimmicky and annoying as it can lead to accidentally powering the headphones off.  Would have much preferred a traditional power switch.  If they ever come out with a Momentum 4, they should ditch this feature. - Doesn't support high fidelity codecs like aptX HD, LDAC, or HWA LHDC.  At least one of those would be nice. Really surprised and disappointed that it doesn't have aptX HD since it's a high end Sennheiser product and does support the standard aptX and aptX LL codecs.  Another nice thing to add if they release a Momentum 4. Conclusion:  If your'e looking for a nice on-ear noise cancelling headset with apt LL, look no further.  If you want high fidelity codecs like aptX HD, LDAC, or HWA LHDC, or the newer aptX adaptive, you'll need to look elsewhere.",4
"Have owned these Sennheiser Momentum 3 wireless headphones for 3 months now and overall they have been great.  They paired with my iPhone X immediately.  Took me a couple days to figure out how to get them to pair with my PC for music, FFXIV and Discord, but once I did, they now seem to miraculously detect whatever I need them for.  It’s amazing. The wireless feature is so nice.  No cord to fumble around with and they can be used at my PC or in my room or out on the patio. Noise cancellation is excellent.  My computer is right off the Great Room, where the TV is and even when the TV is loud, the music on my headphones completely drowns it out. The sound quality might be a little cleaner if they were wired but not enough that it matters much.  They are very enjoyable to listen to music with and they are clear even at high volume. When I speak on discord, they sound good to other people.  When I record on Webex, the sound is a little less full (a little more hollow) than my wired Corsair HS60 Pro headphones that have an external mic. Communication is still very functional, though, and you could probably buy an attachable external mic for under $10 if that is important to you. Have not measured hours of use but have only needed to charge the headphones 4 times in 3 months, which is pretty good — not a nuisance.  They charge to full in about 2 hours. The Sennheiser Momentum 3’s feel solid and look really good on.  In terms of comfort, I’d say above average due to the ability to precisely adjust the drop to your ear height and soft ear cups.  And they’re a little less bulky than my wired Corsair HS60 Pros. If you want wireless noise cancelling headphones with great sounding music and do not want to move to the $500-600 price range for a small incremental increase in clarity, I highly recommend the Sennheiser Momentum 3’s.",5
"I’m a mostly earbud user. Lately I’ve had the Sony XM3’s  and I’ve just gotten some Jabra 75T’s. A little background, I’m in the electrical  line industry. That means a ton of traveling, a lot of living in loud hotels, and not a lot of isolation. I loved the Sony earbuds ANC, but hated the lack of water resistance. In my industry we’re working in the rain, so I had to switch to the Jabras, which means I required a set of ANC headphones. Now let’s get to the Sennheisers! -The case sucks. You’re most likely going to be traveling with these, and a soft case is a no-go. I bought a separate hard case for them on amazon, problem solved, just something to be aware of. If you’re not traveling a lot, the case should be fine. -the sound is insane. Crystal clear, bass is plenty FOR MOST but I’m beyond impressed. I just got them but I’ve played six genres already and they all sounded great. -Coming from the Sony Earbuds, the ANC is really good, but if you’re someone whose had top of the line ANC headphones in the past, I’m not sure how it would stack up. I did notice that the Sony 1000 series over the war set did have better ANC than these, though these will drown out plenty. -Aesthetically, these look better than 95% of the market in my eyes. Also the earcups feel comfortable and luxurious. -Price: they are worth it. -The app is not as good as Sony’s but the EQ is simple enough to play with and it’s easy to get to what you want. -I prefer hard buttons over touch controls, especially at the gym, so this works for me. If you want touch controls, Sony is your place. -battery life is good if you’re coming from earbuds, but bad if you’ve been rocking wireless over the ear sets. Me personally, I’m cool with it, but that’s because I have the jabra’s to pick up the slack If need be. So all in all, I’m feeling pretty great about the sennheisers. Get a hard shell case and you’ll have a great set of ANC headphones!",5
"Even though I love music and have several pair of headphones, I probably fall short of being called an audiophile as I don’t know most of the technical terms related to headphones. So here’s my decidedly layman’s review: Received these today. Been listening to these off-and-on since. Even compared them to three of my other headphones (Beats Studio Wireless, Beats Studio Wired, and B&O H4 Wireless). This certainly outperforms all three (plus my Wireless Parrots) in almost and maybe every way. So far, I can confidently say these are the best headphones I’ve ever owned. Sound - best sounding headphones I’ve ever owned with the most accuracy of sound. I used to really like headphones that emphasized the bass (thus the previous Bests headphones), but now I lean toward more accuracy of sound. The bass is still there, but it’s not overpowering. ANC - these are the first headphones I’ve owned where I think I actually prefer to listen in Noise Cancelling mode. Usually I find ANC to flatten the sound, but here I find it actually results in slightly more depth and breadth of the sound field. So far, I seem to gravitate to the Anti-Wind setting which equates to the medium ANC setting. Battery Life - they arrived out of the box with 20% battery life. After playing with them a bit, I decided I better get them to a full charge. Probably because I kept checking on them, it seemed like they might not ever get past 60%, but after leaving them alone longer they reached 100%. They dipped down to 80% earlier but another charge and they were pretty quickly back to 100%. So far, much better than my Parrots which had the worst battery life of any wireless headphones I’ve ever owned. I also like that by pressing the middle button on the right cup, it verbally tells you the remaining battery life. In addition, you can see the battery life on the app on your phone as well as on the battery section on your iPhone itself. Been listening you them over an hour since last full charge and they’re still at 100%. Controls - I find them pretty intuitive. Phone paired pretty easily with my iPhone. It took a little more persistence to pair it with the Bluetooth adapter attached to my old school home stereo system, but that probably has more to do with my adapter and my own learning curve (adapter is new too). The top button is for turning ANC on or off as well turning Transparent Hearing on or off. So far, I like ANC on and Transparent Hearing turned off. That may change once I can travel (fly) for work again. Apps - the primary app is pretty cool. There are three ANC settings - Max, Anti Wind (medium), and Anti Pressure (low).  So far, I find I like the aural soundscape of Anti Wind the best. It also tells you if you have Transparent Hearing turned on or off. You can also turn TH on/off via the app. There also is an equalizer but as opposed to my B&Os, so far I find I find I like it better if I leave it alone. As noted above it also tells you your remaining battery life. There is also a separate Tile app available you can use to locate your headphones. Through the app, you can see how close you are to your headphones as well “find” them by causing them to vibrate and emit a signal. Useful for sure, but I wish they emitted a louder sound. Not sure I’d hear them if there was any other sound around like in a loud airport. A little about how I’ve used them today and what I’ve listened to: Listened to a lot of Madonna today. Ray of Light album was first thing I tried out via my iPhone (Apple Music) as it has a pretty ambient soundscape. I wasn’t quite as blown away as I had hoped, but headphones did a very good job. This might be one where tampering with equalizer might be useful. I also listened to soundtrack for movie W.E.  Wow. Sounded just phenomenal. Also listened to Sinead O’Connor’s Lion and the Cobra on vinyl via Bluetooth adapter connected to old school sound system. Overall, it did a good job given I was listening via pieced together technology. I’ll probably go back to just listening to vinyl on speakers, but still need to try it out with CD player. After, I did listen to Sinead’s I Want Your (Hands on Me) on my iPhone (Apple Music) and it sounded great although I did detect a bit of white noise hiss, but I attribute that more to it being an analog recording that likely hasn’t been digitally remastered. Also, some Ben Platt (also Apple Music on iPhone). Sounds great. Now listening to Madonna Madame X (Apple Music on iPhone). Sounds pretty phenomenal  and I’m finding it a bit of fun to tamper with the equalizer on this one. Also, since I have an iPhone, I didn’t bother messing with setting up Alexa as my assistant. I’ll stick with Siri. For three years, I’ve known my next headphones would probably either be Sennheiser or Master & Dynamic. After doing a lot of research again recently before purchasing these, I think I made the right choice. Update: Day 2 Woke up late this morning and grabbed my headphones which have been charging overnight. Soon as I put them on, they automatically paired with my iPhone and started playing Lucky Star which I had started before I went to bed last night. I listened to rest of Madonna’s debut album as well. Her debut isn’t the most aurally nuanced (which is one of its charms). I’ve also listened to this album a ton since it came out in 1983 so wasn’t expecting any major surprises. However, I noticed certain elements that haven’t been as prominent to me before like certain percussion elements (Borderline) or saxophone riffs (I Know It) or synthesizer flourishes (Holiday/Think of Me). I do notice the headphones being a little more “touchy” as far as turning off/pausing if I touch them or turn so one of the cups touches a pillow. Not too annoying though. Just tried to recreate making it pause with those same motions and it didn’t do it now. Also sometimes when I put them around my neck or put them down, they automatically quit playing but often I have to put them in folded up position to turn them off although using middle button on right cup also seems to work. I don’t find (as some users have) that the phones are super sensitive to how they’re folded to be turned off so I like that. As long as they’re folded, they turn off. Wireless reach - I forgot to mention that when I listened to vinyl last night, the stereo is on second floor and I was in living room and I had no loss of signal so that was good. Loudness - phones do get plenty loud (certainly loud enough). Do I wish they got a bit louder? Sure, but they get quite loud for wireless headphones and it’s probably a good thing for my hearing they don’t get louder. Another Update: I don’t really use headphones for phone calls so can’t comment on that. Case - I actually like it. Much better than no case (I had to order a third party for my B&O headphones) or just a cloth bag. I know some would prefer a harder outer shell to the case and are worried their headphones will get damaged in their bag through the case, but it’s not like I’m gonna be packing ginsu knives in my totes or duffels. The cloth case will actually help it take up less room in my bag. I also like the inner pouch to hold the charging cable and cord for wired listening. I agree the equalizer could be a little more well designed (I actually like the equalizer on the B&O app), but I’m having more fun playing with it.",5
"I love Sennheiser's sound! I had a pair of HD380 pro headphones from Sennheiser that I loved. My daughter broke them so I used it as an opportunity to switch to a wireless pair. I listened to the Aiwa arc-1, Bose QC 35, Bose 700, Jabra Elite 85, Sennheiser Momentum 2, Sennheiser Momentum 3 and Beats Studio 3 headphones. They all sound good but the cleanest and most accurate sound AND feeling (yes, your bass should produce a physical sensation) is the Sennheiser Momentum 3. I originally purchased the Momentum 2 headphones but the ear cups were a little to small for me and it felt like my ear was to close to the speaker. The Momentum 3 has larger ear cups and more padding. I have had no issues with connectivity and the sound is amazing. Noise cancellation is ok, which is not the reason I buy headphones at this price. If you want a great sound that you can tweak even more with their app, I'd recommend the Sennheiser Momentum 3.",5
"So I really wanted these to be amazing for the $350 price tag. Overall they're a beautiful product, here are my thoughts. Look: They look awesome and have a really cool style to them. Feel: Very comfortable, the cushions don't put too much pressure on your ears or the top of your head. Your entire ear will fit in the cushion which was a huge selling feature for me. Music: These things rock when it comes to sound Battery: Battery life sucks of these... The advertised hours are a joke, you'll be lucky if you get 4 hours before they die on you. Charging: You have to fold them for them to charge, which is annoying if you have a headphone stand or under desk hanger. USB-C: The USB-C charger was a great feature Bluetooth: Yeah the bluetooth would get super confused when connected to two devices, which they advertise as a feature. It's just not smart enough yet there. ANC: Not great, and honestly very upsetting. Depending on how you move your head the ANC changed... and it didn't do much. Power-On/Off: So you can't leave them unfolded if you want them to power off and charge, you need to fold them up for that to work, and like i said before, it's very annoying. The engineers try too hard to be ""progressive"" with their tech, without regular people testing the product first. Final thoughts: I decided to go with the Sony WH-1000XM4 ANC which were $299 and were almost perfect in every category but a handful: Style was 'eh' and the cushions are pleather and small, so they put pressure on your ear and make you sweat. For someone who wears glasses the Sony's were very uncomfortable for long term use. However the battery life and literally every other feature was UNREAL. I would wear the sonys for 14 hours straight and still have battery left over for the next day. After Apple announced their new AirPod Max (over-ear ANC headphones) I decided to try them out. Turns out they are EVEN BETTER than the Sony. Ears fir inside the cushion, cushion is fabric and you don't sweat, the ANC is actually much better, and the bluetooth easily connected between my apple iphone and macbook. The price was steep, and the weird purse thing is a joke, but if you can get past that I have to say I was really impressed with the Apple product so they made the cut and are now my final choice.",3
"I got these to use for zoom meetings in a WFH situation. They sound great, as expected in this category. The personal taste is going to be up to the individual, so I won’t go into it. The noise cancellation is acceptable, again it’s going to be a preference thing. There are three levels plus off. I use them on the lowest level mostly, and that helps block clarinet practice upstairs. I wish there was a setting that actually could make my children quiet for a time... The battery lasts longer than I can stand to wear them comfortably which is 4-5 hours. I haven’t had them go below 60%. The main reason I got them is that I have huge ears. The soft, real leather, ear pads are big enough for my freakishly large ears to fit in if I’m really careful. I have tried Beyerdynamic Lagoons, and the B&W px7, neither of them have leather pads or anything like the space. Another plus over the others are physical buttons and a switch. I just have to feel for the bum on the button to pause music or answer a call. The downsides are relatively minor for me but I will spell them out: 1) they have the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously, but I have them paired up with three. The automated voice calls any Bluetooth connection a phone. There is no way to specifically label the voice prompt computer or tablet, everything is a phone. I can never tell which device is “ phone 1” or “phone 2”. 2)The headphones have an on/off feature that happens when you fold and unfold them. It would be fine if you always folded them up when you are done, but if you put them on a stand or hook it won’t turn off. They do have an alternate method to turn them off, but it is the multi-purpose button that you use to start and stop. I am concerned that holding this button for 5 seconds will wear it out sooner than I would prefer. No direct evidence, but that’s my experience. I will update this if something changes.",5
"This headset doesn't work with any of my devices despite saying it's compatible. I can't recommend it at all. The noise cancellation, sound quality and battery life on these are amazing, if only they would actually connect and stay connected to anything. Despite weeks of trouble shooting, buying extra dongles for bluetooth they will not connect to my PC, they barely stay connected to my phone constantly cutting in and out when walking. I've currently resigned myself to just plugging them into my PC which allows the headphones to work but not the mic which means I've got a second headset plugged in for the mic alone. I love them but I also hate them.",1
"I use them for daily commute and listening on my iPhone. Noise canceling is acceptable when riding on the bus, it has 3 settings. I like physical buttons, less confusing to use. I returned first pair because disconnecting too often for no reason or just after a simple head movement. Sound on first pair was superb,  outstanding sub lows And clarity of sounds, well defined, rich but not overpowering. Soundstage feeling pretty amazing. It reminded me the sound from HD 800. Replacement set so far doesn’t disconnect. However sound is not as top notch as first pair, diminished sub lows, tested with same music and equalizer settings and volume. I even compared both sets before returning first set(if it wouldn’t disconnect so much I would have kept first one) that low rumbling low base that spreads around with enough force to feel it but subtle at same time and extremely hard to reproduce with regular speakers/headphones is almost non existing on the second pair. I’m considering returning it and buying another brand or maybe trying my luck with a third set? Pros: Great sound quality, materials, look and feeling. Clamping force is just enough to hold them in place without squishing my ears/head. I don’t feel them at all even after wearing them for hours.  Noise canceling can be turned of and on. They are not a huge size. Balanced sound doesn’t cause fatigue after prolonged use. Ear pads are made of leather and foam , plush and very comfortable. Cons: no lock on sliders to adjust and keep size. Don’t fold flat. No power button to turn them off(they turn off by folding them of pressing volume button for several seconds) Variable quality of manufacturing, comparing both I had one with more sub lows and beautiful sound than the other) phone Application need improvement, disconnect after every single action taken even though it was just looking at options. Horrible. If you are a perfectionist would notice ear pads are not even made, With some improvements could be a great pair of headphones one of the top three! I still like the sound",4
"After a bunch of hours of research, I decided to drop the big bucks on the Momentum 3's (M3W) and was left tremendously impressed. Key points as to what I was looking for A: Good seal for travel when I'm on the train B: Best audio quality possible within a 400$ Budget C: Minimum of 15 hours battery life. The 7 hours I got used to from my backbeat 3100's (Good audio quality but trash connectivity) D: Does not look objectively ugly E: Ideally metal construction to last longer (Plastic ATH M50's snapped for no reason after 5 years) Optional: Connection to more than 1 Device The M3W's manage to have a super strong band and metal arms, great seal, excellent quality real leather ear cups, ability to connect to multiple devices, app with an equalizer so I can not get slapped by the heavy bass , best sound compared to the alternatives which keeps up with my DT 880 Premium's (In a quiet room cause these are open back) and to  top it all off is an average 20 hour battery life and they look fantastic in person. The main reason I chose the M3W's over the Alts is because the alts had a SOLID advantage in noise canceling (Data center and network engineers, keep your eyes on those WH-1000XM3's) but were lost in the sound quality category which was paramount for me since ANC was not a huge deal for my needs. I still came out very happy on the other end because the ANC on these are still VERY solid and I am now able to game in the living room with the AC full blast and be able to hear everything perfectly. Apparently there were issues with software but with the latest firmware available, I had almost zero issues.  I'd give these bad boys a 9/10 and  a super solid recommendation. NOTE: If you are bass sensitive like me, be ready to lower the bass on these and have an equalization app on windows at the ready but this is more a point of preference and not a determent. Alternative options: Sony WH-1000XM3's - Killer ANC, great sound, full plastic frame which is a negative to me after the arm of my ATH M50's snapped after 5 years. Now I only buy metal framed. Bose QuietComfort 35 II/QC35's -  Also a fantastic option but plastic and not a looker in my opinion. Amiron Wireless Copper's - The build quality and alcantara fabric used in the construction are utterly breath taking but beyerdynamic (My fav company after Audio Technica's build quality failed me) messed up one VERY important element. The seal is garbage and severely impacts the sound quality to the point where 1 song and I had to throw them in the box and return em. Maybe next time.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Audio: The quality of the audio is good. When in comparison to other Noise Cancelling headphones, this headset has definitely got some better bass. Bluetooth: Major drawback in my headset. This headset is not able to take the phone calls. My momentum headset got paired to bluetooth and status on my phone shows that it got connected for audio and calls. When I make phone calls, the headset is not being used on calls. In the video you can see, the bluetooth headset is connected and when I try to connect on calls its disconnecting itself from calls with message ""call ..."". Very bad experience. Another drawback is range. I couldn't give exact numbers on distance between phone and headset but this headset didn't work similar to other headsets I have been using. An approx 10m is max. It breaks a lot. Design: It's an impressive design. I wear glasses and I got pain wearing these glasses for 40min. If you compare the comfort and fit, of HD series headphones with momentum, you will notice that momentum's design is lagging a lot. It looks good though. 4/5 on looks! But 1/5 on comfort and fit. A pouch is provided to pack your headphones. It resembles very much to my childhood lunch box. I like it though! Noise Cancellation: If you are a person who get headaches to noise cancellation, you can find this section of data useful. Noise Cancellation in these headphones are bit lighter compared to the competitors, however, I still got headache with these headphones. It has an option of transparent hearing which feels like relieving some pressure inside and allowing some outside sound, but I still got headache. So definitely a NO to me on these headphones.",2
"I have set of warn in HD580 so I can say the sound is nearly as good with emphasis in the base but the ""convenience"" features were a complete deal-breaker for me.  One, play-pause feature gets triggered by laying the unit on a table top...WHAT?  Off button is a soft button meaning a 2 second press of the play/pause button, irritating when the unit is half second slow in response time...this includes volume changes, Bluetooth request/cancellation, next-track and so on.  And the last straw, goes to maximum volume every-time I pause a video.  I know this is all maybe a firmware away to being solved but I'm tired of expensive things being stupid in the era of face-recognition smart phones.",3
"After several tries with multiple wireless earbuds including Beats Pros, Sennheiser TW2 and CX 400BT, I ended up here. These sound excellent for bluetooth and they are infinitely more functional compared to the earbuds, which tended to fall out in spite of the size options for earpieces. One caveat you might discover if you purchase: There seems to be a glitch in the Sennheiser app related to processes of the Smart Pause feature - I kept getting a lot of cut offs in the sound when moving around, even when turning my head. I turned off the Smart Pause in the app and the headphones have worked flawlessly since.  17 hrs per charge beats 7 hrs for the ear buds every time.",5
"Perhaps my expectations for this headphone was  just too high but I feel is that aside for an excellent sound, everything else, i. e. comfort, connectivity,  battery, and noise cancellation is below average. I have Sennheuser HD650 so I am very familiar with Sennheiser’s sound signature and Momentum 3 sound is excellent. However, comfort is bad, really bad. For someone who is bald like myself pressure on the top of the head is unbearable and a clamping force is too strong. Battery life is a joke, as I was able to get only 9 hours from a fully charged one playing at 50% volume. And noise cancellation is about as good as my old Bose QC25 wired headset which isn’t much by today’s standards. It feels like different teams worked on designing this pair and that sound team took lead and made everyone to do what they wanted, deliver excellent sound and all other teams had to sacrifice their details to achieve sound quality goal. So your #1 priority is a sound quality, those are headphones for you. As for me, they weren’t the one.",2
"Pros: Better call quality. Way better. Better noise cancelation. It’s not Bose 700 good, but it’s good enough for living next to a busy street in Manhattan. Neutral Range isn’t perceptively better than the Momentum 2 for me. If I go my bathroom 15 feet away in my studio apartment it starts cracking. I’m guessing it’s having trouble with the million other 2.4GHz devices nearby. Cons It has a USB-C charger but absolutely refuses to charge with any of my USB-C power bricks (Apple and Anker). So much for just taking just my laptop charger with me! Funnily enough, it will work if you use a USB-C to A adapter and back again. For that reason it charges slowly. The low battery life in class would be fine if it could at least charge quickly. It has a habit of continuing to play a “leftover tone” at a very low volume after playing some sound. It sounds like a very quiet tinnitus. This with a MacBook Pro. AAC mode does work with the MacBook Pro, but there’s very high latency. It makes YouTube videos look like poorly lip-synced dubs. This seems to resolve with periodic resetting of Bluetooth from the MBP side. I don’t know if this is an inherent issue with the codec or a hardware issue, but Sennheiser should just fall back to AptX here. Slightly superior sound quality is not worth how much delay there is. If you’re a competitive gamer, it would be unacceptable. It seems like a lot of these issues could be resolved. I wouldn’t purchase based on could, though.",3
"I break headphones, usually on the arm just over the cup, despite my best efforts not to (lift off both cups gently at the same time and only as far as I need to remove them). These will not have that problem, while I have concerns about the hinges in the long-term, it's an easier fix with a screwdriver than having to break out the Gorilla Glue. The battery life averaging 17 hours is a boon as these are not intended for extremely long sessions. The padding on the headband will be giving you a headache by the time you run the battery from full to empty in a session. You can use them as wired headphones as well while charging, which is a feature I've leaned on a few times to save my battery. The noise cancellation is pretty decent as well, my favorite feature is the Transparent Hearing, you will want to have it set to leave the music playing in the app, this way you can have a conversation with someone without losing all audio from whatever you might be doing, it's also helpful to keep yourself from speaking too loud when using the mic. Speaking of the mic is, it's alright. I'm just told I sound different, but I don't have many audiophile friends that can describe it other than, ""not bad, just different."" I used the app to drag the EQ a bit up and to the left to get the bit extra bass I like, it's simplified interface is something to get used to, I had a good idea what levels to move where when I find myself working with only a draggable button on a field. I was considering the Sony XM3s, while some aspects have me thinking the Sony's would be better, the build quality makes up for it, plus genuine leather. Sony may set the hardware standard, but on a flagship product, they couldn't care less if the cups breathe. Gotta keep it all in perspective. Leather.",5
A dozer operator I know wears these while working and convinced me to purchase them. I thought if he can hear them over that thing surely they will work on my tractor.  They are awesome. The noise canceling can’t quite take out a tractor at full throttle but It reduces it to a background noise. Anything less it eliminates. The sound is so rich and the controls are easy to operate. I love that you can either hit the switch to hear someone talking to you or just slide them down on your neck to pause playing. Very well thought out. Very sturdy also with the metal band. We are not in a gentle environment in the woods and they are totally indifferent to it. Literally the only negative I can think of is the hinge where you open and close them to turn on and off. It has bit me a time two so watch where the side of your fingers are.,5
"So while I would not consider myself an ""audiophile"". I do like a rich and vibrant sound. This headset while having what, I personally would call a poor battery life, as its closer to 10 hours at best. As to the noise cancellation, I had to  turn it off and on like 30 times to figure out if there was even a difference.  The off the head sleep mode, was annoying and I had to turn that off, if the headset was even a tad off your ear it would turn off. I can see moving it down to the neck doing to sleep but even pulling it away from your ear for more than a few seconds it would turn off. The redeeming feature, to me was the sound quality. The range was very surprising for me and their was a rich and great sound (at least to my ear) on the default settings for Low, Mid and High, so was great across the range. I did notice what many complain about the popping and crackling in Bluetooth mode. However, for me this only occurs when I have it linked to more than 1 Bluetooth device. So I find myself clearing the pairing list often, as I move it between devices. With the drawbacks, maybe it should really be a 3 star. But I was impressed with the sound quality to feel it deserved less than a 4.",4
"Bought these to upgrade from my Sennheiser Momentum 2 headphones that I purchased a few years ago. YES these are worth the extra $$$ to upgrade. Observations Sound quality is significantly improved over the Momentum 2's.  Hard to describe but it is richer, the background sounds in the recording come out and FLAC audio plays beautifully on them. The smart application is a little buggy but not worth taking a point off.  having to delete and re-add is a little annoying. Firmware update process for the headphones was painless however. Transparent hearing is a nice new feature.  Keeps ANC (active noise cancellation) active but mid range sounds (voice) transmits through.  Also a plus when singing as your own voice comes through loud and clear. The EQ is interesting.  Jury is still out on full benefits but you can definitely hear differences as you adjust realtime. Verdict?  Indulge your ears and buy them.",5
"The Sennheiser Momentum 3's are above average in most categories, and the best in one (my opinion). Noise canceling is pretty good, though nowhere near the Sony XM4, Bose NC 700 and AirPods Max.  They also fall short of the B&W PX7's.  However, for me, they do knock out enough of the noise that it is acceptable.  It is not adjustable, but you can select a couple different noise canceling modes through the app. Comfort - The ear cups are leather and very comfortable.  They do not heat up and I barely notice they are there.  The headband, however, is noticeable to me.  Not painfully so, but I do have to adjust every so often. Controls - The buttons work pretty well.  I wish the center media button was a little more pronounced as I sometimes hit the volume up or down buttons when I mean to do something else.  The B&W PX7's and AirPods Max have the better pushbutton controls (love the Max crown), while the Sony X4 and Bose NC 700 use more of the touch controls (this can be good and bad). Transparency Mode - This works really well, though I wish it automatically reduced the audio volume slightly if you have it set to continue playing.  You can also set it up in the app to mute the music when you put it into transparency mode, but for some reason it does not pause the music like the MTW2 earbuds do.  So you put it into transparency mode, have a conversation, come back to the music and a new song may be playing.  Not a big deal but a little annoying.  AirPods Max still takes the cake for transparency mode.  Sony XM4 ambient mode works well, but it always seems to lose my setting every so often and I have to go into the app and adjust.  The Bose NC 700 is really nice with adjustable noise canceling as well as going all the way to transparency mode. Battery - Battery life is not great, but sufficient for my use.  I feel like battery life should be at least 20 hours these days, with ANC on.  Bose NC 700 and AirPods Max hit it right on. Sony and B&W PX7 blow past it.  My use with these headphones tends to be a few hours at a time and mostly in my house, so it is not an issue.  However, I certainly hope that the Momentum 4's address this issue whenever they come out. Connections - Pairing between two devices is easy, reliable and it will switch between the sources very quickly. App - The app is just ok.  It always seems to take a couple tries to connect when I open it.  Sony is more reliable.  Bose is even more reliable and faster.  I do like the EQ and being able to tweak the sound, though I do tend to listen in Neutral.  You can also change noise canceling levels between Max, Anti-Wind and Anti-Pressure.  My biggest complaint about this is that I have to go into the app to do it. You can turn off the noise canceling by pushing a button on the headphones, but you cannot switch between modes without opening the app. Call quality - I am told that call quality is pretty good.  People can understand me clearly and I can hear them very well.  Better than the Sony XM4.  Much better than the B&W PX7.  Not as good as the Bose NC 700 or the AirPods Max (and Airpods Pro for that matter) As I said, the Momentum 3's do all of the above very well, but there is usually one other headset that can do it better (though not always the same one).  What does it do best?  Sound.  These things sound awesome!  I know this is very subjective, but to me, the sound stage is wide, I can hear everything crisply and clearly, and the bass is noticeable but not overwhelming.  I am not an audiophile, but I do really enjoy these.",5
"So, you might be like me. You might see these and think - Hey, I love my Sennheiser 58x, 6xx, 800etc etc, so why not get that nice Sennheiser sound in some ANC cans? Reviews seem fairly positive. Let's try 'em. I turned on my typical test tracks and was assaulted by a molasses flood of boomy, blooming, soggy bass. It was like listening to music underwater, with the volume turned to 11. And I'm a bass-head. I own several headphones famous for bass, and I bass boost them. No, this is something different. Doesn't even sound like music. It's just an offensive mess. I set the  EQ to -5 bass (maximum) and it made the mess quieter, but no less messy. Do you remember sitting at a stop light back in 2010 or so listening to that beat up car rattling and going wubbawubbawubbawuba all mess and no music? Well, if you're nostalgic for that, you're in luck. On to my third complaint about bass: It's small. Some headphones have an impressive high resolution ""wall of sound"" where you are enveloped. Not these, it's like two tiny horrible sounding subwoofers that don't even blend to the music. The mids? Not bad actually. A bit recessed. Outside of the bass bleed, they sound fairly average. And highs? A bit harsh while still being laid back. A -5,+2,+3 eq made the headphones listenable, but not good. No EQ setting could save this mess. Look - if you listen to Beats headphones and think they're wonderful, you might like these. IF you listen to literally any quality headphones (audeze, other sennheisers, etymotic, even koss) you're going to have a bad time. And the soundstage? It's weird. It's not placed correctly, and frequencies don't blend right. What about ANC? Well, it's passable. The transparency mode works OK if the music isn't playing. Usage? You have to fold them to shut them down. While I like that folding shuts them down, they need another way. I store headphones on hooks and don't want to adjust them every time. Comfort? Pretty solid, actually. But there's plenty of  comfortable cans that actually sound good. Battery life? Well, I don't know. I've tried many, many headphones. These are the only ones I straight up couldn't stand to listen to. They are /offensively bad./ What the heck, Sennheiser?",2
"I had a pair of M2 for several years, and loved them to death. Travelled in all climates, situations, several countries, across oceans, in bed, playing games, yada yada yada. They recently broke so I ordered a new pair on Amazon alongside the newer M3, so I have been A/Bing these for several hours, with all types of music, from Bob Dylan to Hiatus Kaiyote, Black Thought to Rage Against the Machine. They both trade blows in different types of music. I feel like metal, hard rock, and faster genres favor the M2. When I listened to ""Killing In The Name"" by Rage Against The Machine, the mids on the M3 felt distant and recessed, almost veiled, whereas the M2 is right in your face and the decay on the instruments is much quicker. Zach's ferocious vocals are much more impactful on the M2, whereas on the M3 they feel like he's further away and the band drowns him out....not what I want for a band like Rage. In hip-hop, like Skepta's ""No Sleep"" the bass feels a bit overly boosted and bloated. It's punchy, but it does sound artificially inflated, whereas with the M2, it's much more neutral and presents the entire spectrum more evenly. I haven't really done much with Sennheiser's EQ in their app, because I never EQ my headphones, but it may be worth a try to even them out a bit. In male and female vocals, both headphones have similarly milky smooth and luscious presentations. In Fiona Apple's ""I Want You to Love Me"" the M3 really shine with the piano in the foreground, while keeping her vocals up close and personal. However, the boosted sub bass can make the strings sound a bit too bloated for my taste. Whereas with the M2, her beautiful vocals are clearer and not muddied by the bloated sub bass. The piano keys are sharper, crisper, and more sparkly. But once the drums come in, the M3 wins. The impact from the larger drivers, you can feel in your bones, it's visceral. The drums on the M2 are just in your head. All in all, it has been an extremely tough decision for me. $355 for the M3 (tax included) and about $185 for the replacement M2. Both are excellent headphones in their own right. The lower battery life of the M3 may cause issues, however I have not had the chance to test that. The one feature I care about is the fact that music pauses on the M3 when they are taken off your head. The M3 seem to have more of a wow factor at times, whereas the M2 are a solid all arounder that is more neutral and will not satiate the modern basshead. If you love visceral bass, you need to choose the M3. I wish Sennheiser kept the physical styling of the M2, because the plastic cups and band style I think are hideous on the M3. They just feel like they won't hold up to the rigors of travel. I stuffed my M2 deep into some very tightly packed bags, tossed them around, wore them in the snow, among many other situations, and they tanked everything. I don't know if I will be able to do the same with the M3. They feel like more of a competitor to the yuppie Bose offerings, which is not something I like. EDIT: Ended up returning them and will keep the M2 for now. The fact that auto pause is triggered by slightly tilting your head to the right with the M3 is a HUGE deal breaker. They sound great, but not great enough to get past that annoying feature.",4
"Currently I own a pair of Sennheiser HD 600 (wired), open ear state of the art headphones. These closed ear Momentum 3's are darn close and without the wires. After playing an SACD, the sound truly kicked in despite Bluetooth compression (nothing beats wired).  Quite satisfied. Super comfortable. You can walk around the house and not realize they are on. They easily paired with my LG Stylo 2 as well as a high end windows PC and WIndows Tablet, etc. The user interface is quite simple just don't use the finger slide EQ, there's an option to toggle this Off for actual sliders. You can save presets as well. In case you're wondering, the hard wired 2.5-3.5mm cable is for those that don't have BlueTooth such a an old Ipod.  3 Modes for power: Overhead is ""On"", collapsed around your neck is Standby and folder is Off unlike the Bose NC 700 where you have to find that little tiny power button. Only downsides I can find are the Noise Cancellation, its fair - not great not bad (Bose wins here) and also the pairing of only 2 Devices, Bose NC 700 wins here as well, they can do 8. The case is a soft shell vs. Bose clam hard shell. I can live with all of those. Upside: Powering options as above, comfort supreme, lightweight (1.4 ounces heavier than Bose - barely noticeable difference we tested both), good support team, high quality hardware, 8.5 to 9 out of 10 rating.",5
"Consistent dropouts from bluetooth connection when sitting in front of television approx. 12 feet away. No discernible reason.  Dropouts while listening to music as well if I turn my head or move in the ""wrong"" direction. Very disappointed in bluetooth inconsistency because this is a pricey pair of cans. I usually end up using my Bose on-ear wireless for television watching. A shame, and I am contemplating selling the Momentums since I bought them for their wireless capability.  BUT, to give credit where it's due:  the sound quality is pure Sennheiser and I notice no difference in the sound quality from my wired Senns (58x Jubilees), in fact, the Momentum 3's may be a tad richer. Your call.",2
"The instrument separation is really good. Sound stage feels nice and wide. People coming from DJ and consumer and entry level headphones will be pleased. Sound signature: Bass - boomy and physical thanks to the large earcups and drivers. It's well contained and tight so it doesn't fizzle out like ""muddy"" base. Mids - they're not unclear but don't stand out like the bass and highs. Vocal listeners should look away from these headphones. Highs - detailed and clear. They don't feel veiled or noisy. Comfort: The earcups are some magic memory foam gentler than any pillow I've slept on. The headband's clamping force is about right for a larger/wider head. Maybe unnoticeable on slimmer/smaller heads. The headband's foam is a bit too firm I'd prefer if they were as soft as the earcups. Buttons work well and their only fault is the rubbery and flimsy feel because of being made of rubber.",4
"Very happy with my Sennheiser Momentum 3!  Next to the Bowers & Wilkins PX7, it's the best sounding headphones I have ever heard!  Very close to my PX7 for detail and soundstage!  Better audio quality than Sony and Bose!  The bass thumps and the highs are so clear!  My PX7 and Momentum 3 are my two favorite headphones!  I have the Bose 700, Sony WH-1000XM3, Bose QC35II, Bose Soundlink II, and Sony WH-XB900N.  Bowers & Wilkins PX7 and Sennheiser Momentum 3 sounds better than all the rest!",5
"For the last 3 month I've been looking for noise cancelling over-ear headphones for myself. Now, when I've made my choice, I'm going to give you a detailed comparison between headphones I'd tried before I made my decision. This review is going to be quite detailed, not one of those short ones. First of all, I had my own criteria that are somewhat personal. Because of those I did not consider any Sony headphones due to their known ""feature"" of an always enabled transparency mode during calls, which is ridiculous, and Bowers &Wilkins PX7 and Shure Aonic 50 due to their unattractive design (very personal thing). Here's a list of my criteria and conclusions about headphones I've tried: 1.Comfortable fit. -Sennheiser PXC 550-II is a winner. They are very comfortable and offer enough adjustment options to have a best fit and cause no discomfort for hours. -Bose NC 700 have somewhat tight fit, but other than that are also very comfortable, no problems wearing them for hours as well. -Bose QC 35-II are OK, but I it takes some time to get used to their fit, cushions could be better for sure. -Soundcore Q30 would be very nice option for using them for hours, but they have such a small amount of padding material that your ears are touching inner part of earcups, very unpleasant experience. - Momentum 3 are VERY heavy, they weight around 0.6 kg and you really feel that! For me they've caused almost an instant headache. That was the main reason why I returned them. 2.High Sound Quality. - Sennheiser Momentum 3 have the best sound on my opinion. Plenty of bass, I did really enjoy listening music with those. - Bose NC 700 sound great as well. I'd say that the sound is more balanced, but I'm not an audio expert and that is just my impression. - Soundcore Q30 are surprisingly good in terms of sound  for the lowest price here. Plus their app has tons of EQ presets, which is not the case with other brands. - Sennheiser PXC 550-II sound quality is good, but nothing impressive, just as no major flaws there. - Bose QC 35-II sound just OK, noticeably worse than PXC 550-II on my opinion. 3.High call quality. - Bose NC 700 should offer the best call quality here. You can adjust sidetone during calls, which is great. Hven't had to many calls with them, but so far so good. - Sennheiser PXC 550-II is definitely a way to go if you need a headset for taking calls. No complaints from people I was talking to, the only downside is that sidetone can be adjusted if a quite odd method using PC and USB connection. - Soundcore Q30 are OK for calls, didn't get an complaints when used them for calls. Sidetone can be turned on/off on the go. - Sennheiser Momentum 3 is OK for calls, had some complaints about robotic sound when used them though. Sidetone can be turned on/off during calls, very convenient. - Bose QC 35-II are the worst on the list. Sidetone is always on and cannot be turned off during calls, good luck trying to use them for a call when you have some serious noise on the background. You can find people complaining about this ""feature"" on a Bose forum for YEARS, but nothing happens. Non of adds or item descriptions mention that, look for something else if you are planning to take calls with headphones on. 4. Noise cancelling features and etc. - Bose NC 700 are way far ahead, no other headphones out of those I've tired are even close. Just perfect. - Sennheiser Momentum 3 are quite good. ANC is decent (but nothing close to Bose NC 700), very convenient to switch between ANC types, transparency is implemented well. - Bose QC 35-II offer great ANC, better than Momentum 3, but no transparency when you need it (better to have it always on for calls, right?). - Soundcore Q30 have the most user-friendly system of ANC controls (transport-outdoor-indoor) out there, but NC by itself is not that great, it works but could be better. - PXC 550-II really suck when it comes to noise cancelling. They feature Adaptive ANC, but the reality is that it is very abrupt, can just turn off for a second and turn back on instantly. I haven't noticed any gradual changes for ANC level when used. ANC controls is a different criteria, but it's so horrible that it affect everything. Even if you just leave it on it may turn off for a second at any time. Transparency mode when not a a call is good thou. 5.Battery life & efficient wired mode. - Soundcore Q30 are miles ahead. They really do last for 40 hours when ANC is on, full charge  via USB-C takes only 2 hours. They also can be used for passive playback via 3.5 cable when turned off, super convenient. - Bose NC 700 have way smaller battery life (20 hrs), but also use USB-C, full charge takes 2.5 hours, can be used with a passive payback via 2.5 to 3.5 cable while turned off. - Bose QC 35-II are pretty similar with Bose NC 700 when it comes to battery, but they use micro-USB, which is less convenient. - Momentum 3 's battery lasts only 17 hours and takes 3 hours for full charge, even thou it also uses USB-C. Cannot be used for passive payback because they are turning on automatically when you unfold them, but if you use included 2.5 to 3.5 cable they turn to some power-saving mode and can be used for longer (I'd used them for 5 hours while they were on 20% charge and they still haven't died). - While PXC-550-II  are advertised to have 30-hour battery life and fully charge within 3 hours, with ANC on they barely last 20 hours and a full charge takes 4 hours ( charge to 80% takes less around 1.5 hours though). But the biggest problem is when you are using them with a wire there is no noticeable change, they don't have any smart mode, even if you turn Bluetooth off (that is the only power-saving feature available) they won't last longer. 6.Ease of use & Controls - Bose NC 700 have a perfect balance between button and touch control, touch controls are very responsive, easy to switch between ANC modes. - Bose QC 35-II feature convenient button controls, you also can switch between connected devices with on/off button. - Sennheiser Momentum 3 have great button controls, really easy to control ANC and transparency modes. But no power button, which is frustrating -Soundcore Q30 button controls are quite well made, can be turned off with a button, transparency mode is easy to use also. The only flaw is that a transparency mode doesn't stop the music playing, which kind of defeats the purpose of that feature. - PXC 500-II touch controls aren't as responsive as Bose NC 700's , still good nonetheless. But ANC control is clearly a nightmare! There is a tiny-tine knob that switches ANC from Max to user mode or to turn it off, but  it's almost impossible to operate it properly on the go. Worst decision ever made by headphone designers. 7. Look & feel -Clearly Sennheiser Momentum 3 have the most unique look and premium feel. Somewhat personal, but their design is truly a step aside from any standard builds. - Bose NC 700 are very minimalistic, and clearly have a premium feel. Look great as well. - Sennheiser PXC 550-II do make a nice impression and definitely don't look cheap. Their earcups also look like horse hoofs, which I personally find amusing. - Bose QC 35-II really look like average headphones, not as much for the price range they fall in (200-300$). No major complaints thou. - Soundcore Q30's look and feel reminds you about their low price as much as they can. Cheap plastic on earcups and loud clicking buttons, lack of padding material in cushions-- ""you get what you've paid for"", as people say. Only the headband looks and feels nice. They could go with more minimalistic approach for the earcups, but they didn't. Bought them only because I the company makes really good earbuds that I absolutely love. Button line -- which one worth the money payed? - No wonder that Soundcore Q30 is a steal. Just the fact that 80$ headphones can compete with 200-400$ rivals says a lot. If you are on the budget and OK with cons I've listed -- that is no-brainer here. - I'd say that Bose NC 700 are too expensive for everyday headphones (hello AirPods Max!), but only they will give you all the feature implemented well and working great without any sacrifices. Sadly but I haven't found any cheaper option that fulfills by needs, even though I would be OK with not as good NC and maybe more standard look & feel. That is why I chose Bose NC 700. - While it has some serious issues, Sennheiser PXC 550-II is also a decent choice if you don't want to break the bank for a pair of headphones. Very comfy and nice looking, I'd stick with those if they had a power button and more stable ANC. - Sennheiser Momentum 3 is a great option even for 300$ price if you are OK with wearing such bulky & heavy headphones for hours. Otherwise it's just a no go. - Finally, I do thing that Bose QC  35-II is the worst decision here and would only work if you need headphones for noise cancelling during flights. The lowest price I saw was 200$ and for those money PXC 500-II is a way better choice. P.S.: attached is a phono of Soundcore Q30, Bose NC 700 and Sennheiser  PXC 550-II from left to right. I've already returned Bose QC 35-II and Sennheiser Momentum 3 because they were no go for me.",4
"Everyone has different criteria for headphones.  Mine were: must be reasonably comfortable for extended wear; must have excellent sound quality for music; must be intuitive and easy to use for work conference calls.  And obviously, Bluetooth pairing had to work smoothly. In other words, I like to listen to music while working but occasionally have to take a call. I read a lot of reviews before buying these and find that the reviewers got it right.  They are easy to use, sound great, and have sort of OK noise cancellation.  I have used Bose noise cancelling phones in the past and those are on a whole different level - the noise cancellation is so effective that it's almost eerie.  As many others have said, the Sennheiser noise cancellation does best with droning sounds such as HVAC. So overall, if your criteria are similar to mine, you'll be happy.  Before I started using these I was using a pair of old Oppo phones which originally sold for $700 (but had no microphone or Bluetooth) so I am used to pretty good sound.  I do not feel deprived listening to these.",4
"These headphones are solidly built with premium materials, including super soft, leather wrapped ear pads, firm but not overbearing metal head clamp. They are very comfortable on your head and ears, you can use them for hours on end without discomfort or overheating. But most importantly: the sound quality is exceptional. You can hear every instrument crisp and clear around you like you are in the middle of the band; electronic music sound fenomenal with lows, mids and highs coming through perfectly uncluttered, dynamic, powerful, no distortion or muffleing. Just fantastic! It is possible to equalize their sound using the app, once you change the equalizer profile it stays on that profile regardless of app connectivity The cable to listen wired could be standard rather than a proprietary Sennheiser design, and I wish you could simply cover an earphone to pause, but the buttons are simple and intuitive. Also, I found that noise cancelling is not bad but could be better, however, the majestic sounds makes up for it by far, imo.",5
"For listeners who care more about sound quality than isolation, these headphones are a must. I upgraded to these from the Sennheiser HD 380 Pro, and I am very happy with them. The attention to detail in the construction and tuning stand out, while the isolation is more focused on enhancing audio quality than it is supreme isolation from all outside noise. The first test drive with these was on a four hour flight. I wore them straight through and had no ear fatigue or discomfort from excess pressure. The ear cups and head band are very soft and comfortable! The talk-through feature allowed me to hold full conversations with my wife and airline stewards without missing anything. Would recommend for someone who is on the go and cares more about a flat response and punchy bass than someone who wants a higher end noise canceling headphone.",5
These are incredible headphones. The only downside is that the bluetooth connection can clip if you wave a body part (arm) between the phone and the headphones when the phone is in a pocket. If that's a huge issue for you keep them in the wired configuration because Sennheiser really created an incredible product with these cans. I came across the very first Momentum headphones in an airport having two hours of time to spend. Being an audiophile I ended up in a store that had every major manufacturers over-ear noise cancelling headphones. This was many years before covid and you could try them out. I went through several of the biggest names and the fourth one was Sennheiser Momentum (they were the initial version). I was blown away by the sound quality and balance. I then looked at the price tag and rationalized that I didn't want to spend that amount on something that was only for my own enjoyment. That experience stuck with me for 4 or 5 years of still wanting them. I finally purchased them and they're even better than the first time. I've tried pushing their limits with every type of music/movie/podcast/content that I can. They are a truly amazing product. This is the first product I've ever given a 5 star review for. My only regret is I didn't bring this audio quality into my life earlier.,5
"I've bought the 3 usual suspects: Sony xxxxM4, Bose xxx700, and this guy. returned 2, and kept the Sennheiser. I also have a Sennheiser HD1, momentum 3 improved on the sound stage and separation. So, Sony is superior for ANC, Bose is superior for call quality. I buy headphones for 1 thing and 1 thing only: sound quality. I've tested every music I like: Classical, Jazz, Rap, Folk, Rock..in every category this Sennheiser killed the other 2 easily. Listening Adele at the Royal Albert Hall made me feel like I am in the front row. Nils Lofgren's I'll Arise, I felt the vibration of his guitar strings. But of course your music has to be at least 16-bit / 44.1 kHz to really enjoy this baby.",5
"I wanted a nice pair of noise cancelling bluetooth headphones that still had a wired option to use without battery via a standard audio jack. Reading about the Momentum 3's had me hopeful they would perfectly fit my needs and they technically do all that but not very well. The noise cancellation on these is not very good at all. You can tell the difference with it on versus off, but just barely. I'm quite happy with the sound quality over both bluetooth and wired. I'm still a bit disappointed in the audio quality though considering the cost for these. The build quality of the headphones themselves are acceptable but the included cable for wired use is terribly cheap, way too short at just over 4 feet and super inconvenient with the smaller 2.5mm twist in jack. I accidentally tugged the cable just slightly and the 2.5mm plug started separating. CHEAP!",2
"Basing this review off headphones I have to compare it with as a casual headphone user, I have the QC25 and Sony WH-1000XM3. Listening to music on Spotify. Sound: Sennheiser takes the win in the sound quality category for sure, when testing side by side along the other two, it provides a much more immersive experience and clearer bass than the other two. Comfort:I would rank the Sennheiser momentum 3 comfort to be under the QC25 and above the Sony. Sennheiser is a bit heavier compared to the other two, but at the same time the plush padding makes up for it, but still the Bose is more comfortable to wear for long duration. Noise isolation: Sennheiser ranks last in terms of noise cancellation, but this does not really affect me too much as my room is fairly quiet already and I don't take these headphone out too often. but if Noise isolation is something you need to have, i would go with the Sony as a better over all pick. Connection: I havent had any issue with the sennheiser, but i do notice the wireless connection on the Sony is a stronger and more stable at longer range. I personally like the physical buttons on the Sennheiser vs the Sony, as it gives instant feed back where as touch control can activate the wrong button. Software wise I would have to give it to the Sony as the Sony has much more option and adjustment available also comes with many preset EQ.",4
"My review after two months of weekly usage! Cons: Bluetooth implementation seems flawed and noice cancellation is just okay. Comparing to my other wireless active noise cancelling headsets that I've tried such as the Beyerdynamic Lagoon ANC, a couple Jabras, and the Sony XM3, my Momentum 3 unit has a noticeably raised noise floor. Thankfully I do not hear any noise during actual playback. But for sure during gaps between songs / videos, I can hear a high pitched hum, or varying pops/clicks. I only ever really noticed it in a quiet home environment vs commuting on the train. Also, there is just noticeable audio-video desync when paired with my Apple iphone or iPad, which I have never experienced with any other wireless headphones. As for the noise cancellation, it was just an added bonus for me but when I am looking for it, it could stand to be stronger or support varying toggleable levels. Battery life is average. I've been able to get through hours long Zoom calls on the Lagoon but the Sennheiser starts to run low under similar conditions. I think the battery readout is also too vague. ""More than 40% battery left"" - Does that mean 59%, or 41%? The hinge on/off mechanic is gimmicky and can actually be painful! Literally on day 2 of ownership I was a little careless and gave myself a nasty pinch on the webbing between my left thumb and forefinger. There is also the concern that when ""off"" (hold the multifunction button while opening the hinge and the voice tells you Power Off), that it is actually still passively draining the battery. The Beyer with its physical on/off switch instills more confidence. Unlike the Beyerdynamic Lagoon ANC, one cannot turn it on and simultaneously use the 3.5mm jack. I want to take advantage of active noice cancelling while still opting for the better sound quality by going wired, but in my tests the sound output level is extremely low and dead sounding when trying to do both at the same time. I was worried I was somehow going to break something so I stopped trying. Pros: Comfort is very good. I usually prefer headphones with larger drivers as the cups/pads tend to be larger too. I do not experience temple or jaw fatigue w headphones (so far), but rather ear-clamp fatigue. I returned the Momentum 2 because the pinch was just too distracting. The M3 cups feel more plush and overall have more surface area contacting the head so less of a gripping sensation on the actual ears. Overall build quality is pretty solid. Less creaky compared to the Beyerdynamic Lagoon. Minimal microphonics with the included 3.5mm cable. Sound is great. For a closed-back headphone targeting the market for mobility + intimacy, the bass has plenty of body but is not overpoweringly rumbling, which is my preference. I found the instrument separation to be excellent and on par with some of the more expensive audiophile grade headphones I've demoed. The Transparent Hearing feature opens up the soundstage even more, even though there is some trickery involved there. I feel like no frequencies in the mix are getting lost here. If I had to nitpick, on more vocal forward genres such as Hip-Hop I found certain voices a tad shouty, or certain piano tones a little sharp. I am more attuned to V-shaped profiles so take with a grain of salt. Attenuating the 1k-2k range with EQ fixed it for me. Overall, a fine, comfortable headphone for casual listening with the added convenience of decent enough wireless capability, but definitely with its quirks.",3
"After a lot of searching I settled on these because I was looking for these requirements: - aptx LL for single player gaming and watching videos on my laptop on my nintendo switch and PC - good sound reproduction - bluetooth multi-point pairing and easy switching between devices - Good call quality - Good comfort - Decent portability - Transparent hearing I think when all these points are taken together, these headphones seem to be the best option of the ones I've seen (assuming price isn't too much of a constraint). It's not fantastic sounding (there are better sounding wireless headsets) and it doesn't have the best feature set (ldac or aptx hd or aptx adaptive would've been nice), but because it hit all the points above I'm pretty happy with it. Here are a few highs and lows: Highs - Built in equalizer that can be configured via the phone app (set it once and it's saved directly into the headphones, no matter what device you're connected to). This was a lifesaver because the bass region on these headphones are overly emphasized. Applying -3dB helped them sound a little more neutral. - Multi-point pairing is a little wonky (can be slow in connecting/disconnecting) but generally works really well - App allows easily switching between connected bluetooth devices - 3 Different levels of ANC, plus ability to turn ANC and transparent hearing off - Folds for portability - usb c charging - lightweight Lows - No track skip button on headphones, only play/pause and volume. Disappointing that volume buttons can't be used for this. - Overemphasized bass (although EQing gets it down to an acceptable level) - No aptx-hd or ldac streaming. Realistically there are probably other elements in the audio chain that are limiting this though (e.g. Spotify). - Only way to power off is to fold in headphones (no power button)",4
"After spending many hours researching wireless headphones I finally decided to give these sennheisers a chance. They are absolutely amazing. Sound quality is exceptional, they are incredibly comfortable, and the leather on these is unbelievably soft. The noise cancelation and battery life isn't the best on the market, but are more than sufficient for my needs and it has worked well for me. If you think these will work for you and are debating getting them, just go for it, they are well worth it. Only real complaint is the travel case it comes with is not very nice, but there are lots of 3rd party cases available for not too much money. I picked up a nice hard shell case for around $10. I haven't experienced any problems with these headphones thus far, but will update my review in the future if any arise.",5
"It's all about the sound!  That's the first thing you should be considering with any audio device.  And the Sennheiser Momentum 3s deliver.  Clear, clean, balanced and a great soundstage.  Whether it's Justin Bieber or Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, these headphones sound great.  Very comfortable, the controls are easy to use, and even though they ""only"" last for 17 hours before needing a charge (compared to 30 hours for some wireless headphones), that is not an issue for me.  Plug them into a USB C port and they charge right up.  I also love the way they collapse up very easily into a nice tight package when not being used.  And considering these are Sennheisers, and of such good quality, the price is very reasonable.  Highly recommended.",5
"I’ll probably update this review over time.  It was at two stars, now down to one... maybe they’ll work their way up to two again. I have since gotten a pair of Shure Aonic 50s, which are outstanding... That’s a lotta money tied up in headphones!  I probably should’ve just bought the new Apple cans instead. In the meanwhile, I’ve exchanged dozens upon dozens of emails with Sennheiser about the myriad issues I’ve had with these.  It all began with an apparently-software and/or firmware-related problem, which developed into further problems (Note: the app is pretty jank too, and none of the updates entirely stopped it from glitching and losing connection, etc. But, it’s a requisite in order to adjust EQ or ANC, et al.). Before I could even manage to get all of the software/firmware/app nonsense worked out, a more serious hardware problem developed.  To wit: the headphones seem to believe that they are still plugged in via the (annoyingly proprietary) 3.5-2.5mm cord, which I did only a few times.  As a result, they’ll no longer let me pair with anything.  This is apparently a common problem people have “fixed” in various ways (“raking the pins,” etc.), many of which I’ve tried to no avail.  How ridiculous: a $350 gadget with a terminally faulty switch/sensor?  Please.  My old school Sony Studio Monitors last a decade, even treated more carelessly. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITSELF.  They’re dismissive, misleading, often give incorrect information, don’t listen carefully to questions (instead generally replying with a prescribed response referring you to something that doesn’t work or isn’t even applicable); and I could go on. Just the other day I got a sarcastic reply from one of their people, who was actually supposed to have called me more than two weeks ago.  I wrote (paraphrasing): “Hello again _____, I’ve now contacted you twice since you were supposed to call me on the telephone, but have heard nothing.  Are you, or are you not, going to contact me.  Please advise.  Respectfully, ____” She replied, “You’re very welcome.”  I thought this might have been sent to me by mistake, so I followed up... she very brusquely replied that my issue would better be handled by yet another department (the 4th so far I think). The above rude transaction took place as I’m simply trying to send them in for warranty repair given the development of this issue that is clearly a hardware problem.  To be clear, I treat all my A/V gear like it’s made of antique glass (Another note: the case these come with is a joke; if you do buy them, get an actual hard case to protect your investment.). Trying to send them in has even become a rigamarole.  I’m almost 2 months into that fiasco now, having sent proof of purchase, serial number, their form, etc. I don’t  even have specific instructions or a shipping box yet.  By the way, it appears they expect YOU to pay for the shipping to get their bunk product repaired, in England, I believe.  Another slap in the face.  This may explain part of my delays here as I flat out refused to do that.  But, at this rate, they’ll be out of warranty before I have even sent them off... and I imagine it will take months in turnaround time too. I realize this review is darn salty; but generally, I try to be very convivial with folks.  Sugar works better than vinegar and all that.  This has worn me down though. If you don’t have the patience for this type of thing, don’t buy these.  As others have commented, the sound quality is exceptional.  Virtually everything else is a train wreck.  What a shame.  Sennheiser has always been so top notch in my experience.  Perhaps they’re better off sticking with the old-school tech.",1
"The headphones randomly pause/mute uncontrollably about every 5 - 10 seconds. I believe it has something to do with the auto pause/mute but after turning off the feature in the app it continued. After I had to register the headphones, create an account and provide all proof of purchase info the manufacturer wanted me to pay for shipping for the return. Next time I will buy these types of things at brick and mortar stores where I can easily swap them for a functioning set. Update: The replacement headphone set also does not work.",2
"...and I've had a lot. As a music maker/producer, my headphones are my lifeline. My preference is towards Sennheiser's and AKG's EQ curve, comfort, isolation, build. These are in a league of their own. First off, the sound is outstanding: very wide, detailed stereo field, good bass presence, but what feels like a neutral EQ. They're great for reference monitors and accurate enough that I can mix with them. And for critical listening or just plain enjoying music, they put a smile on my face! And with the app, you can program your own EQ profiles. Comfort: they're not light, but have leather ear cups and a tight seal so you can comfortably wear them for hours, with no ear fatigue. The sound isolation is exemplary and also has a transparency mode. Best feature: they're full-size headphones, but fold neatly: on/off is controlled by folding/unfolding them. Battery life is great and the Bluetooth is dependable. Quality: they're incredibly-well built for comfort and durability. I feel they'll last for many years. Cons: tiny bit glitchy when it comes to calling. Moving your head can automatically cause them to mute and unmute. To troubleshoot, you just have to wait 3-5 seconds after you power them up until you put them on (must be something to do with the noise-canceling feature). All in all, outstanding in every way. They sound incredible, look incredible, and are built to last. Buy em!",5
"I wish I were writing a 5 star review, as I would be if my model were up to par with what I assume to be the normal product. It is the best headphone for sound quality at this range and I've tried just about all of them. Soundstage is grander than the WH1000xm3, PX, M2, and MDR1A all duct taped together. Bass is powerful yet tight, mids are clear, treble is detailed. Vocals are thick and pronounced even with the massive soundstage. I don't understand how they've done that. However - Battery life and noise cancellation are second rate to NC700/WH1000xm3/PX7. *My (Only) complaint* My model has a hissing noise in the top left driver on songs that feature long bass notes. It's un-ignorable. If you wish to test if yours has it, look up ""bass test hz"" on youtube and click the black and green video. It's safe and non-boosted. If you have a defective model, the hiss will be unmistakable. Can't give this product 5 stars because it is a major hindrance on some of my favorite songs. Also can't give it 3 because it's only noticeable on a minority of songs.",4
"While perhaps not the most precise reproduction of every frequency, the soundstage created by these is amazing. coupled with the noise cancellation, I find I can close my eyes and just experience the music. I have periodic Bluetooth connection issues, but it may be my iPhone with too many Bluetooth items. A toggling of Bluetooth on my phone fixes it. Lastly, the auto-pause is pretty good. It’s not perfect, but if you wait the 5s to let it calibrate it’s great. If it’s a problem, you can use the app to turn it off. Overall I recommend them without reservation over the Sony competition or any headphones in this price range.",5
"I've tested a bunch of leading noise-cancelling, over-ear headphones in the last few months. All the top brands -- AKG, Sennheiser, Master & Dynamic, Beyerdynamic, Philips, Sony, Shure. And the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless have the best sound, without question. Very good imaging, detail, soundstage. A bass-forward sound signature that can be well-tuned in the app. Very nice construction. High quality. There are a few flaws, though. These cans are heavy, so fatigue could be an issue. Also, there are some wonky connectivity issues, as the Bluetooth range and connection with the app are wonky at times. Finally, the battery life isn't as good as the competition.",4
"I have a dozen mid range headphones like apple, bose and so on.  This Momentum 3 is now my favorite.  It’s app and simple button set up is much easier to use than my numerous other brands.  As far as sound quality, I have no idea because of 40 years of jet turbine noise.  Volume is the only valid comment I can make and it is good.  They saved space by not having and on/off switch.  I couldn’t get it off and neither could the Amazon tech until I closed it up for return.  Bang, off it went. I was very pleased not to return my now favorite headphone set.  I might be the only one who has had this problem, but maybe one other user might be helped.  The manual gets 2 stars.",5
"The auto play/pause feature is too sensitive. It would pause my music when I turned my head. Bluetooth connectivity seems poor. Every few minutes or so I would get a small hiccup in the sound. Very annoying. The folding mechanism can PINCH THE S*** out of you! Be careful. Pretty weighty headphones, after wearing for 15 min or so it started causing discomfort on the crown of my head. You cannot use just any usb c for charging. Mac chargers wont do it. You cannot use just any aux cable either! The jack on the phones is smaller than the average one. Sound quality was pretty good but the bass was lacking I found a pair of bluetooth headphones for half the price that I like a lot more. If these were cheaper headphones I wouldn't leave such a critical review. But for $400 I expect a better functioning device.",2
"Battery stopped charging after 1 week of use -- tried plugging in the headphones both in the open and closed state, and resetting the headphones didn't help either. When the battery still worked, the noise cancellation on these headphones was not that great -- I live in an area where there's a lot of traffic and transit noise, and these headphones were unable to block those out, where my IEMs with foam tips were able to isolate a lot better. One positive thing I can say is that the pads are soft and don't make the sides of my head too warm. If the headband were a little less hard and had a little more padding, I would feel comfortable wearing these for more than 1 hour at a time.",1
"I'm returning my 2nd pair of these headphones because the cut out when you turn your head left, right, or up and down. Never had a headphone do this before. The 2nd pair I got from Amazon is worse than the first pair I had. These cut out for up to 15-20 at a time. The first pair i had would cut out from 3-5 seconds. Thats very annoying.  I have some Sony Mx950's and they dont do this. Bad product by Sennheiser. They sound great tho. I give them that.",1
"I'm returning it, plain and simple. Not worth all this money. Hard wire is not a default setting, Requires sequencing of controls to get to. Starts searching for wireless devices the moment it's turned on. No choice. Not as loud as advertised. My $40 Sonys are louder and more dynamic right out of the box, no fuss. This Sennheiser Consumer Audio M3AEBTXL sound is not crisp or dynamic, too muffled. Needs too much equalizer programming applications to achieve sound quality. Also, battery verbal alert will only state battery above 80% capacity. Will not state if fully charged or at 100% no matter how long you leave it on a charger. I charged it for 3 days, same result. Really disappointed that something so expensive has to be so heavily customized and programmed by an average consumer. And then will not even charge to 100%. Lesson learned here.",1
"I have these as well as a set of the Bose 700s. For my primary use, the audio on these is amazing, which is why I'm rating them at 4 stars. Where they fall a little short is the features. The controls could be a little better and the auto pause feature while very cool and a nice add is too sensitive and will pause your music when you yawn or otherwise shift your head sometimes. My other complaint is when these are paired to multiple devices sometimes they can be touchy with which device they take sound from. So if I'm watching TV on them an I get a text message it cuts the sound from the TV and will not reconnect until I power them down and re start them. Annoying but something that can be worked around. If you are using these for listening to TV, or HiFi music the sound on these is dramatically better than the competitors. If  You are planning to use these paired on your phone for travel etc, the Bose 700s may be a better choice.",4
"I have bought and listened extensively to the Sony WH-1000XM4, Bose NCH 700 (wife’s) and the Bower & Wilkins PX7 and the Sennheiser Momentum 2’s AND 3’s. Without a doubt, not even close, the Sennheisers sound signature blew away all of the others! I read many reviews comparing the Bose and Sony’s to the Sennheisers and all I can say is that Bose and Sony must be paying people to write favorable reviews for them! If you want a noise cancelling headphone that you can take calls on, then Bose and Sony make fine products for you. If you want a Bluetooth headphone that delivers awesome, warm, bassy sound that puts a smile to your face, then get the Sennheisers. Heck, the Moentum 2’s sound better than the Bose, Sony’s and B&Ws! Seriously, the Sennheisers cancel sound just fine, take phone calls clearly and turn off and on just by putting them on your head. Not only that, Sennheisers are mad of metal and real leather, not plastic and faux leather like the others. I can listen to my Sennheisers for hours, while the others would give me a headache after a few minutes. For the life of me, I don’t why more people are not buying these cans. Just. Awesome. Sound! Don’t believe the hype surrounding the Bose and Sony’s.",5
"I am Sennheiser fan, so the review may have some bias. I have been used this headphone for 3 weeks. Overall, it is good product. pros: 1. Excellent sound. I always has no question for Sennheiser’s sound. 2. Comfort to wear. The headphones looks like a huge one, but it feels comfortable when wearing it. 3. I like physical control buttons. However, all those buttons are on your right side. However, I perfer the left. 4. Battery is good. Cons 1. Noise Cancellation. Emmmm….I don’t think Sennheiser knows how to do noise cancellation for his product. The noise cancellation is not what I expect. Sony or Bose products are doing much better. 2. This is an over-ear headphone, not works for long time wearing in the hot weather. 3. Still a little bit heavy. 4. Two weeks after I bought it, Amazon gives an 50 dollars off…(Can you hear my heart is crying? T_T) Conclusion. If you are looking for a good sound quality headphone, without high requirement for noise cancellation, for example, at work or study in the library. This is exactly the right product. But if you simply just looking for good noise cancellation headphone and do not care about the sound. I believe there will be many other choices for you.",4
"These points are all in comparison to the Sennheiser Momentum 2 1. More expensive 2. Heavier, less comfortable (grips your ears more tightly, top band is more padded though) 3. Worse sound quality (less bass, quieter, less dynamic) 4. Worse battery life (~18hrs vs ~22) 5. Makes the last tab I had opened in Chrome start playing automatically NOT through the headphones, but through my computer speakers. While it's nice you can just unfold the headphones to turn them on, this makes them unusable for an office environment. 6. Worse bluetooth range. Pros: 1. Better at connecting to bluetooth 2. Unfold/fold to turn off/on Overall they're not bad per se, but kind of a step down.",3
"I was looking for a great-sounding pair of ANC headphones. I read many reviews before I made my decision to go with the Sennheiser Momentum 3s. I probably own too many pairs of headphones already, but I love listening to great audio so I consider them a good investment. Have everything from Beats to Bose to JBL etc. When I looked at these I was comparing them with some of the usual big hitters in ANC - Sony XM4s and Bose 700s. My #1 interest above all was audio quality. I use them mostly at home when working on my laptop. The best ANC or call quality wasn't my pure focus since I don't use them much for travel or business calls. So many of the reviews I read touted the Momentum 3s as superb sound quality and a great choice if you're looking for amazing sounding audio above all else. So I purchased these and let me say that I was not disappointed. These sound fantastic - crisp and well-balanced audio. Everything sounds so clean and yet powerful. I love them. I also really like the retro styling of these. I went with the Sandy White pair and they just look cool and classy. If you're looking for the best all-around or more concerned with ANC and battery life, then there may be slightly better options out there - but for what I was looking for and putting audio quality above all else, these are absolutely fantastic. I listen to many different genres of music and they all sound great on these. There is plenty of bass if that's what you're looking for but not overwhelming and not at the cost of losing any of the balance in the mids/highs. The graphic equalizer on the Sennheiser app is nice if you want to make some tweaks to the sound. Bottom line - if you're looking for a great sounding pair of high-quality headphones, these are an excellent choice!",5
"No, these do not sound quite as good as a high quality wired set, but they sound very good considering they are wireless. If you are expecting the same just don't buy wireless. Battery life is very good and running them is not difficult. The app is pretty good with a very unique eq that takes some playing with to get right. I also use it in conjunction with my music player eq and they do very well together. These have great separation, good deep bass, and have the typical Sennheiser awesome mids and highs. Definitely a step above good for wireless.",5
"*** I AM MOSTLY A PC USER which isn’t really apart of the target market for these things, but I was looking for something wireless and light because I travel around a lot with a computer and I hate wires. LACK OF PC software: I know Pc users often get gaming headsets and  they’re not the target, but having no software is frustrating. See next sectio SMART PAUSE: first let me say, I was ready to return these things. Every time I looked down to my paper when taking notes, it would turn the head set off, then when I looked back up, it would go back on. That’s smart pause. As I understand it, the feature serves to turn the headset off when you’ve dropped them to your shoulders or take them off, but  Once you break the headset in and it starts getting uncalibrated from putting it on difference surfaces, the pauses happen at even less deliberate movements of your head. Small tilts of the head would cause it to pause. I tried turning off smart pause on the iPhone app but after I closed the app the settings would never save when I connected to my pc and disconnected from phone Bluetooth . I almost gave up but after a software update, I was able to turn off smart pause permanently by toggling it off in the app! The noise cancelling on these headphones is extremely It’s hard to describe but it feels as though the noise cancelling completely mutes ambient noises without making you feel like you’re on completely silenced from everything going on around you. If the door bell rings or something, I usually can still hear it if the volume isn’t too high which is a feature I appreciate. That said, if you’re using them to block out all noise, like on an airplane or something, I’d prefer something a little stronger - but these are perfect for my usage. Range; I can still hear these things in my bathroom upstairs, surprisingly excellent Sound quality: very high for wireless, but I’m not much of an audiophile. Battery life: once you turn off smart pause( which is a must if you intend on moving your head at all while using these) it’s pretty bad. It’s been 2 months and I think I get 10 hours of battery on a full charge ? Maybe it’s the industry standard but I’m constantly needing to charge these. Build quality; feels great at first but even after a few months of use, I can tell the frames feels flimsy, I feel like it would snap immediately if I stepped on them or something. Looks good, but definitely cheap materials outside actual ear pad radius",3
"Superb sound. Don't really care about noise cancellation (at home anyway, havin't tried them on a plane, for example). But....dammit...I sure get driven nuts with a couple of things. Connections......connects to my tv with zero problem...but no sound most of the time. Have to disconnect  and reconnect to get them to work. And I don't like the way they pause. Sometimes an inadvertant movement of the right earcup makes them pause....so I have to fuss with them to get them unpaused. Sure wish there was a way to just disable the pause feature in the app. That said...GREAT sound...I'd buy them again, even with the niggles.",4
"I would give it 5 stars, except for one major design flaw: the metal hinges that bend when you fold the headphones are sharp, and it’s easy to pinch your skin. (So easy, in fact, that there’s a warning label in the box about it!) I’ve been very careful, but after a few months of owning the headphones and using them daily, I’ve pinched the skin on my hand twice, both times drawing blood. I have no idea why this design flaw needs to exist, considering that I had both of the previous versions of the Momentum headphones and never had this issue.",4
"I had read a couple reviews complaining that the headphones can ""pinch"" your hand when you're unfolding them. I didn't realize it was so bad. The first time it happened, they actually drew blood! The second time it happened nearly did so as well. It hasn't happened a third time because I'm so careful now. The other thing, which I didn't see in any of the reviews I read, is that these headphones are just barely too heavy. While I've never had this problem with any headphones before, my neck actually hurts a little bit after wearing these for more than a couple of hours. Pros: the sound is fantastic, the app has an equalizer. It comes with an aux cable if you are bad about keeping it recharged. Charge cable is the same as my android phone. Battery life is really quite good though. Overall I sorely regret not getting Bose instead.",3
"I upgraded from the previous version (2.0), that I owned for 4+ years, and I can still use them - the 2.0 I own can't charge anymore, because of the port that broken of too many uses (they were used almost every single day, for at least 8h). I upgraded to these, and I can tell that while in terms of ANC if wasn't upgraded that much, the sound does live up to expectations. The sound quality is really good, and you can listen to pretty much anything as if it was played in front of you (kinda exaggerating, of course there's better headphones, but good for the price). The ANC is not as good as it could have been - but the sound quality definitely makes it for me, as it's good enough with sounds (and the ANC) that it actually hides pretty anything else. On the battery side, it lasts for about 16h from my use which is more that enough (volume dependent), especially if you travel a lot. The USB-C/A port makes it very easy to charge everywhere, and if you're without charge within 10 minutes it gets you to about an hour of charge, which is incredible if it's a long trip. Microphone - perfect for casual use, people might notice you're talking through the headset but the sound is very clear All in all, a very solid headset! Something I learned: if you feel annoyed by the sound stopping when you do a specific movement, - feat not! Just disable the ""Smart Pause"" feature in the mobile app, and when re-enabling it, it'll allow you to calibrate it to yourself so it actually becomes smart, and it does work every well. If you have the 2.0 and it still works as expected, I don't think it's an upgrade (in terms of price - if you can afford it, go for it). In all other cases, go for it! There's also other nice-to-have features, which just makes the overall experience amazing.",5
"Quality These headphones are high quality, no doubt. Leather and metal, nothing cheap about the build. I am rough on headphones, these will last you. Annoyances The 'smart' features are more of a hassle than a help, however. It is supposed to auto-pause and play when you take the headphones on and off. It will sometimes pause even though you didn't take the headphones off. More frustrating is the auto-switching. This can connect to 2 devices. When you start playing something on another device, it will automatically switch. Sometimes this works. Most of the time, you'll have to take the headphones off, close them, and open them to reset them. Or go on the device and manually switch it/disable Bluetooth on the device you don't want to hear. It's just a hassle really. I will be listening to something on my PC and then my phone gets an email, so the headphones switch over so I can hear the notification sound, but it won't switch back. Good The audio quality is great, as to be expected for the price. I will say, it's not as good as other headphones in this price range, the bass can sound overpowering with the Noise Cancelling on, and I love bass. But this bass isn't that clean, somewhat muddy. You can edit the EQ manually though, in the Smart Control app. Dont pay MSRP for these, not convinced they are worth it. But, I don't regret getting them. If you get used to the bugs with the smart features, these are simply nice Bluetooth headphones.",3
"I really do like these headphones, but they don't like me. Kept on automatically pausing my music and disconnecting from my phone. Maybe because I wore glasses, idk. But our relationship came to an end due to inconsistency.  -also they need to have the option to turn off Bluetooth so you can plug into the phone via audio cable and know that your saving power.",2
"These headphones, while visually pleasing and comfortable, miss the mark for me. * You cannot charge the headphones using a USB-C PD cable * ""Transparency-mode"" pauses the music and lets outside noise in, but you seemingly can't do both (maybe I did it wrong) * I was expecting warm reproduction of audio, but this bass-heavy monstrosity lacked mid-range punch and drowned out any hope of redemption with muddled and indecisive bass; vocals sound pretty damn good though so... /shrug * There is over a millimeter of play with the USB-C charge port in the headphone housing, so have fun returning your headphones to Sennheiser in a year after that falls apart and stops charging I was really hoping this was a step up from the original Momentum Wireless cans which I loved, but had to return twice due to charging ports and buttons failing over time. I jumped at the chance to own a pair of Momentum 3s with USB-C charging (oh, the future looks bright!) but I see Sennheiser is still cutting corners. Bummer :-/",1
"These headphones have a sensor to detect when the headphones have been taken off called ""smart pause"". Which sounds great, except that if I'm eating food the headphones turn off. If I'm drinking water they turn off. If I lean back into a pillow, it turns off. This ""feature"" causes WAY more problems than it's worth. Six months in and I want to throw them out the window it's so annoying. I had the predecessor headphones that I was much happier with.",1
"I've owned these headphones for nearly a year and love most of the features and overall quality/sound, but the Bluetooth connectivity has been a consistent pain to troubleshoot. In previous circumstances I was able to reestablish connectivity by following the help documents/app, but now they won't even go into pairing mode and I'm left with an expensive pair of wired headphones. I suspect there's an issue with the 3.5 mm headphone jack, when being unplugged, doesn't flip back to Bluetooth connectivity mode. I've reached out to Sennheiser support, but have yet to hear back. I'll be looking at different options and suggest others do the same. I'll update this review if Sennheiser support responds and a positive resolution is achieved.",1
"After using these cans, it is hard to go back to any other headphones. The sony xm3's and the bose 700 offer better noise canceling when compared to the Sennheiser's. But no one is going to need such a high level of noise-canceling in regular use unless they are frequent flyers. The sound quality is where the Sennheiser's shine. They have heavy bass without compromising the mids and highs. It makes any kind of music fun and enjoyable. You will never be disappointed with this purchase. People who value sound quality and comfort should definitely have this as their number 1 priority. The comfort is super amazing. so soft and the real lambskin leather enables me to wear it for prolonged time periods. They are Sennheiser, you can't go wrong.",5
"If you are looking for the best sound quality within this price range, this is the one. Sennheiser does not disappoint. But this headphone has been such a pain for online meetings as it has 1. frequent connectivity issue 2. unstable motion control. For #1, Bluetooth connection is often off with my Macbook (works fine with my phone though), which I experienced it several times a day. Aa for #2, if the headphone slides just a little bit from the ""right"" position or angle, it automatically mutes the microphone and it's extremely frustrating to turn it back on because sometimes I can't get that right angle over my head. Thus, for online meetings, I'm switching back to more reliable wireless earphone. I really do love the sound quality but unfortunately I won't use it as frequent as I thought I would.",3
When using these headphones with the blue tooth connection to a Sony A/V receiver the maximum volume is still too low for useful listening if you are doing anything besides sitting down. I use them while walking on a treadmill and even with the excellent noise-canceling these headphones have the volume is insufficient. My fix was to cut off the blue tooth and attach the headphones to the receiver with a 25-foot cable.,4
"1. Sound quality. They have curve on which sound will change in a first several months. This is unusual long curve, my ATH-M50x passed through this process much faster - it took two to three weeks. First month they sounded with excessive sub-bas, but lacking the punch at the same time. Next couple months excessive sub-bas gone, but sound was a bit hot with to much high frequency for my taste and still lacks mid-bass. Finally after about 3 month they sounds perfectly. Sound with bluetooth connection is very good, with usb it even better - you can hear more details and wider soundstage. Overall this is no-brainer best sound quality-wise ANC headphones on the market right now. 2. ANC One thing I noticed, Momentum 3 has very weak passive isolation, leading me never use it's ambient mode. Active noise cancellation blocks high amount of low frequency, but not much else. If it has better passive isolation, I think they'll be much closer to ANC performance of Sony's 1000XM3. 3. Battery Only 17 hours, but it's enough for me.",4
"Very good headphone for folks who know what music is supposed to sound like. Very comfortable to wear. It needs a better case though if you want to pack it — a hard shell, preferably. There may be better headphones for noise reduction (ANC), but, in some cases those vendors have sacrificed sound quality - I am thinking now of Sony which ruined their headphone when they went to the XM3. Their XM2 had been terrific!",5
"The good:  The music quality is off the hook, noticeably better than similarly priced headphones that I bought a few years ago.  It really is THAT good. The bad:  1) they are effectively useless for phone calls.  Whenever I try I get yelled at by my friends “I can barely hear you!” 2) the battery drains when not in use.  Inevitably I forget to plug in, so they are frequently dead when I need them. The verdict:  If you want to rock out with killer sound, buy em.  If you want general use headphones, look elsewhere",4
"Many other headphones come with the promise of gimmicks, all these features that really... at the end of the day you don't need. Do some of them make your life easier? Yes. But you don't need them. The only extra with real value is ANC but even that (at least for me) does not win out in importance over sound quality. With these headphones Sennheiser seems to have focused on one thing: beautiful sound. Do they have the best battery life? No, but they have plenty, I don't know anyone who listens to music for more than a couple hours anyway and as someone who's had some very long commutes, the battery life is fine. They also don't have all the cool software features of the Sony WH-1000XMH4 (and yes I did purchase the Sonys as well to try them) or the best of the best ANC. What makes these headphones worthy pf 5 stars is simply that they sound beautiful, absolutely beautiful. They recreate sound with amazing clarity and detail for wireless headphones, definitely a good step above the Sonys, so if you're anything like me and it really just comes down to the sound quality for you get these headphones.",5
"I did a lot of looking around before I purchased these.  I spent a lot of time reading blogs and checking out youtube videos and did some physical shopping as well and I am very glad I purchased these. Beyond the way they look (which I love--they have the old school charm of the headphones plugged into stereos in the 70s and 80s) they sound great, integrate with my phone and other sources easily, and the absolute kicker for me is the transparency mode. I find that noise cancelling headphones often leave me with a headache--apparently some people like myself experience ANC as ear pain--for me transparency mode cures that and also keeps me safe while I'm walking in my neighborhood.",5
"Everyone know how good these sound...but one major flaw is the bluetooth. Not blaming Sennheiser, since this is a general issue with bluetooth, but buyers should know. Even with bluetooth 5.0.  A- it often drop even at arm's length. B-. Lag, simply not suitable for gaming. Especially, online shooters like PUBG.  The smart pause--though nice most of the time- can be accidentaly truggered and can be annoying when you are just moving around.  ( reviewed with firmware 3.1.3)",4
"I wanted to like these headphones, but both my initial order and my replacement pair arrived with defective hardware on the right side. The first pair was ~60% quieter on the left, and the second had loud static with active noise cancelling enabled. The app is next to useless and these particular ear pads grew uncomfortable for extended listening. I'd say 4.5 stars of ""meets expectations"" if it weren't for the quality control issues.",3
"Accidentally clipped my finger when I was unfolding the headphone. Bluetooth priority is confusing. About the smart pause, it happened once that my iPhone started playing music instead of playing from the headphone for about 2 seconds. Not sure whether this related to iOS 13 or  not.",3
"I bought these  hoping for a decent sounding headphones.  That, they delivered, but there are some issues w these. The human hair thin connector jack first died out on one channel.  Then the other channel - now worthless.  The three way switch to inject the sound isolation circuit now only flips to two of the selections.  Connection issues are prevalent.  As long as the headphones have been charged - no problems.  Just don't be 20' away OR turn your head too quickly.  I had a pair of IEMs from this company - sounded good - but the bluetooth connection was weak on those as well.  Bluetooth is like on version 5 right now.  There should be no bluetooth issues.  Decent sound fair to poor battery life and the overall cheapness of the plastic/switches leads me to not recommend these.  Especially since there are many other headphones for the same amount of money.",3
"5/5 Sound quality when wireless. When I plugged in for wired sound expecting to be blown away, the output was only occurring in one ear. No matter... I plan on using these wirless 95% of the time 3/5 Noise Cancellation. Being generous with this grade. I love how their are three settings (4 if you include transparent hearing), but the settings differ from ""is noise cancellation on? (Low)"" to ""ah! I think it is on. (Medium/""Wind setting?"")"" to ""I guess it is on.. but ill just turn the volume up. (Max)"" 1/5 Accessories: Well they included the charger... but not the usb-c block. When using other companies blocks, such as apple, I have heard but not experienced that there have been issues. The headphone cord simply does not work. The carrying case will carry your headphones but by no means protect. Design is great and why I am not giving this 2 stars. But a lot of issues with this product. Only reason why I have not returned them yet is because I ordered a different pair of headphones and waiting for them to be delivered.",3
"Amazing sound, great for pop and metal Updates: My subjective opinions: After one week of serious listening on these, the bass sounds too much. The headband adjuster is loose and I need to adjust them constantly. The earcup is just a little bit too small for me (I have big head and ears) but it shouldn't be a problem for most of the people. Overall, this headphone is probably the best choice for noise cancelling headphone. Before purchase, you should consider if you really need noise cancelling - if not, there are many, many better choices.",4
"My old Momentums died out on me so it was time for an upgrade. The sounds on this is stellar, i enjoy the small equalizer you get in the downloadable app. I tested out the noise cancellation and it does a pretty good job, im not disappointed in any way! Other than me having a small head so i have to break them in so they dont squeeze my head too hard! I look forward to playing games with these one too. Worth the money",5
Awesome set of headphones. Moving from Studio Beats to these was such an improvement. Sound quality is very good. The noise canceling is really good as well. Feel really nice on the head. The build quality is top notch. Just wish the ear cups were made of cloth instead of the leatherette. Kind of pricey but well worth the upgrade. You will not be disappointed.,5
Not a audiophile guy but it does sound like Sony's WHXM3 which provides similar sound quality but better ANC. The lows are really heavy and ruin the mids and highs.,3
"When I turn my head to the side headphones think I’m taking them off, pausing audio. That’s mildly annoying. When multiple devices are connected, headphones have a mind of their own on what should be played and where. I’ve messed with this a lot and it is very squirrelly. You can pause your music turn on a YouTube video, and it will mute the youtube video and resume your music on the other device (not through headphones). OR you have to figure out which app is the preferred app at the time on which device, otherwise your music/video will auto pause over and over until you disconnect all your devices and only have one source of audio on one device. You cannot play music in the background while on a call. I cannot stress enough how annoying this is 6 MONTHS into owning the headphones. The sound quality, is excellent. They are comfortable for a long time, and the battery life/noise canceling are fine. If they can fix the ""smart"" software these headphones will be excellent. As it stands I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.",3
"I purchased an open box pair of headphones which were in pristine condition for $250 US dollars. Unlike most YouTube reviews of these headphones I found the carrying case to be great, and water proof/resistant judging by its zipper. Great sounding cans, modern Tech with Bluetooth 5.0 and a super solid construction. Metal headband with sheepskin leader.",5
Used these for listening to music and watching television.  In theory they were supposed to be able to pair to 2 devices.  Sometimes they would and other times not.  The final straw was when I wanted to use them on my phone and they wouldn't unpair with the TV.  At that point in time I was beyond the return time on Amazon so I put them in the trash.,3
"these were an upgrade to my vmoda lp. at first i was considering buying another headset from vmoda but since it would have costed me around 400 dollars anyway i decided to look around the market at the 400 dollar price range. after much research i found these to be the best at the price range and bought them. after about 2+ months using them i can say for a fact that this is the best headphones i have owned, the quality is top notch, premium materials, and physical buttons. the sound quality after tuning it to my ears  it is superb. i have no complaints at all",5
"I've been shopping around for a great pair of noise cancelling headphones for a few months now. I have been working from home and now I am preparing to take the bar, but I have a roommate who also works from home. Our desks are 10 feet apart and now, when I'm studying with these on, I can't hear her at all. The options and sensitivity of these are A1 and far surpass the need I had for them.",5
"If like myself, you just care about audio quality this is the choice for you! The noise cancelling is decent but not perfect, also there is some static noises that can be heard at certain times. Battery life is also decent. I dont know if this is a common issue but there seems to be an issue with the sensors on the ear muffs which put calls on mute when i haven't moved them away from my ears at all. All in all minor complaints on an otherwise good product",5
"The new bass king.  Deeper and more quantity of bass than any other headphones Ive heard including the bass cannons JVC SZ2000.  It's a Sennheiser.  You wont be disappointed.  If it doesn't rattle every single neuron in your brain, then you can return it.  It wont leave a single one left out.",5
"Sound is the best I have heard coming from noise cancelling headphones The noise cancelling is top notch and they are comfortable enough to a point where I can listen to these for hours at a time. Build quality, materials are also up there. Way better fit and sound than my previous pair of Sennheiser PXC 550. I give it 4 out of 5 only because there is a pinch issue when you unfold the ear cups that grabs the skin on your hand between your thumb and index finger. Doesn't happen all the time but you'll notice it when it does.",4
"There is a slight static noise with the Vocals of singers at higher volumes out of the box.But if you adjust the EQ with the Smart Control app just a tiny hair,it goes away.So it must have something to do with the sound digitalizer or whatever it's called.But besides that these sound amazing.",5
"Excellent headphones with clear sound and comfortable. Main issue : Youtube keeps pausing after 5s. The headphone has a smart feature called : Smart pause that automatically pause whatever you are listening when you take the headphone off. Sadly, it is buggy. A google search will show that some users experience this including mine so I had to return them. In my case, despite turning the option off via an apps, turning off and on the headphone, and reading solution online like updating the firmware. The issue still happens.  So I have to return them.",3
These are the 2nd pair of Sennheiser’s that I have owned. I owned the M2’s before buying the M3’s. I’m going to get this out of the way 1st. The M3’s are the best headphones on the market currently at any price point in terms of sound quality. These headphones are more for delivering high quality sound vs say Bose noise cancelling headphones that are more catered to noise cancellation. I rather listen to rich music with optimum isolation from background noise vs perfect isolation and mediocre sound. Buy them if you are serious about listening to music the way it was made in the studio.,5
"I LOVE these headphones! I changed from the Beats over-the-ear ones to these and it’s definitely a noticeable upgrade. The battery seems to last a super long time, it links to my phone very quickly after being turned on, and it was the auto on/off when the headphones are folded in/out. It’s so easy! Completely seamless. The sound is fantastic! I’m new to the noise canceling world so have nothing to compare it to, but I can’t hear anything else when these are on. I love the look of them and they feel super luxe too. Totally ditching any other headphones I have (other that the Sennheiser’s in-ear ones cause those are amazeballs as well).",5
"I would highly recommend these over Bose, AirPods max, Sony’s, and any other headphones in the price range if you like the look of these. The sound is tremendous, but the retro look and high quality feel really help drive this product home for me. Unfortunately there is a downside to these headphones and that is the noise canceling. While not bad, I was expecting much more figuring my old $100 pair of headphones has just as good noise cancelling as these. It gets the job done, but at a price rate of $400, I was hoping to say more than that about the noise cancelling.",5
"Love these headphones.  I bought (and returned) 4 different bluetooth headphones before keeping these (including the Focal Listens which I hated). The sound is very clear and full. I didn't want the Bose because it makes every song sound like ""Bose"". The app/EQ lets you tune the music to your taste, I like heavy bass on some songs, but not on EVERY song. The only con I can think of is, the Soundstage is small... BUT you can put bigger pads on these to open it up a bit, Brainwavz Ovals do a very nice job.",5
"The sound coming through these headphones is amazing. The soundstage is amazing. It's like going from 2D to 3D when comparing it to many headphones in the price range. This allows you to appreciate the detail in each instrument and voice. The materials feel very durable, well made, and comfortable. They are snug, without being too tight. They also come with quite a few convenient features that make them very practical too. I would strongly recommend them to anyone looking for great sounding BT headphones.",5
"I love the build quality and sound. I own the HD650, so it's safe to say I expect a lot from Sennheiser headphones. The noise cancelation is passable but less than impressive. The battery life is more than enough for me but significantly less than others at this price point. The real issues are connectivity. I often lose connection outdoors sporadically. It's almost as if someone is pulling on the non-existent cable. Furthermore I am unable to connect to the tile app. That said I would award 5 stars if these last two issues were resolved.",3
My Son LOVES them.  He has a great ear for music and has high expectations.  These have exceeded our expectations.  He frequently uses them wired without noise cancellation ant that has been great too.  Nice to not have to worry if they are charged.  Uses them regularly on iPhone and Mac Book Pro.,5
"I PAID FOR A 3 YEAR WARRANTY THROUGH AMAZON PRIME (ASIN BO7PC35J78) WITH ASURION. WHEN THIS PRODUCT GOT DAMAGED I CONTACTED ASURION APPROXIMATELY 3 WEEKS AGO, THEN ON JUNE 2 AND AGAIN TODAY. I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD BACK. THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND AMAZON SHOULD NO LONGER BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INSURANCE WHICH IS KNOWN TO HAVE AN EXTREMELY LOW AND POOR RATING. HOPEFULLY AS A LONG TIME MEMBER OF AMAZON PRIME, AMAZON WILL BE ABLE TO ASSIST ME SO THAT THE DAMAGED PRODUCT CAN BE REPLACED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. THANKS.",5
"The positive is the speaker sound quality.  It's fantastic.  However, the bluetooth doesn't work at all and the mic is horrible.  No one can hear me when I use them to make a call and in the middle of every call the bluetooth disconnects.  I was so excited to get these and now I'm stuck with a $350 pile of junk.  I'm going back to Bose. I should have never tried to ""upgrade"" from Bose as they always worked well.",1
These headphones  are the best when  i get more money iam buying a secound pair  these headphones  sound incredible  the only one thing i didnt like is they should of came with a hard shell case,5
I love this product strictly for the music quality. If you want noise cancellation call quality go with the bows for call quality and the Sony XM three for noise cancellation. However if you want strictly music go with these you will not be disappointed,5
great sound and built quality is un matched. Not the best ANC out there but among the top three. this is my second pair and have been a Sennheiser fan since.,5
"These are outstanding over-ear, wireless headphones. They are lightweight, easily adjustable for fit and the sound quality is very good. The cup-mounted buttons are easy to use and quite intuitive. Battery life looks good too!",5
"Incredible fn sound...if you’re laying stationary, on your back. Don’t move an inch though, or they’ll the Bluetooth connection. To anything, really. iPhone, iPad, MacBook... it’s a damn shame that headphones of the quality (the sound is A+) could have hangups like this",3
"Great sounding, comfortable, and 4/5 on noise cancellation. Folding on/off is very convenient. USB-C for fast charging. Well worth the cost imo.",5
"These headphones sound great playing music. They sound terrible on phone calls, and are very quirky interacting with apple products. Example connecting to my Apple TV  4K, it kept disconnecting and starting the music on my phone. Disappointed in the quality of the product over all. There were stitches missing in the headband as well. Wanted to like these but was very disappointed.",2
"Very pleased, well executed product that is worth the money... Design: Can’t say enough - material, form, function - the art of industrial design is alive and well in the country of its birthplace Sound: My tastes -  classical, opera, jazz - all sound excellent Controls: Intuitive, tactile with firm locating and operating feedback Setup - flawless and simultaneous  connection to 2 iPhones 8 iOS 14.1 Comfort - great, easily adjustable",5
"These headphones bring great quality sound, seamless pairing, and a working mic for phone calls. Very comfortable. The auto-pause feature is sometimes a little finicky, but otherwise an excellent pair of headphones.",5
These sound just ok. Heard static out of left side but they were also too big for my head and when I laid down they’d fall off. Very bulky compared to Sony 1000.,3
The sound on this model is phenomenal. I upgraded from the first gen and was sceptical about it being that much better and was happily proven wrong.,5
"Hey all I'm going to say if you're looking for BLUETOOTH headphones with the highest sound quality stop looking...these headphones had me sounding like a 80's valley girl ""OMG!!""  May not have the best anc in its class or the best battery but with sound like this who cares!! Money well spent!!",5
Noise cancellation is good enough to drown out the background noise of plane engines while on a flight. Some of the best sound quality I've ever had with headphones. The bass booms but doesn't ever drown out highs or mids. Battery life will last you a flight from Seattle to Ft Lauderdale.,5
Got someones returned dirty used pair of headphones i dont know how amazon considers this new gross,1
Replaced my xm 4 with these once and they sound so much better but not as good ANC,5
Really pleased with the purchase. I bought them for my wife's birthday gift and they sounded great and looks trendy.,5
"I got the momentum 3's strictly for sound ANC isn't a concern. Wow these deliver on sound, bass very impressive, mids for vocals and highs are spot on",5
"As stated in the title, the sound quality was great as to be expected from Sennheiser. The improved controls in comparison to the last model were the main selling point for me. Battery life is a bit worse then the momentum 2.0 but it is livable.",4
Sounds great and is easy to connect to my devices.,5
What i liked of this product was ear size. I have big ears but that is the only good quality. What i dislike is the sound and ANC they r too weak for a $300 earphones. I rather go back to my $170 earphone then keep these. And it has all the features of this one.,2
"I've had my pair for about 8 months and have had numerous issues, such as Bluetooth disconnections, static, and today the right side stopped working. I'm very disappointed and this will probably be my last pair from Sennheiser. *Update Senheiser replaced the broken headphones and the new ones have been working great for a few months now!",5
"Absolute garbage for its price. - Flaky behavior. Switches between devices or loses connection constantly. - Sound is very subpar. Not terrible, but not better than 30$ headphones.",2
Amazing sound ! So crisp and clear with great base. These look retro but have all the modern features. I live they turn on when opened and pause / play when removed or put back on. Way better than Bose hands down.,5
Amazing quality that you would associate with Sennheiser. Returned it though because I have a rather small head and it had the tendency to shift around/fall off if I were to move my head around or look down.,4
Omg Tool in these. Omg... It's like listening to my monitor audios in my headphones.,5
heavy on the head,3
"Sound quality was bad. Any higher frequency would show that clearly a driver was damaged. Had to return. Sorry for such a high-end device, it should not happen.",2
Amazing sound. They sound exactly like a $400 pair of sennheisers should,5
"You cannot mute the microphone via the mute button on the headset in windows 10, teams or Skype",1
Bought a month ago. 2 weeks later speakers started to blow. Figured just defective. Replaced with warranty and same thing happened. Sennheiser claims no break in period required at all and only ran 3/4 volume at most for use. Besides the speakers blowing out the auto pause can be finicky.,2
thanks you Good product,5
"This headphone set is premium. It’s got great sound, great battery life, and exceedingly comfortable to wear, and can even be worn, lying down.",5
"Blue tooth sucks, it disconnects or stop working mid call, noise isolation sucks too. Not worth the price tag. Buying Sony next.",1
Defective product wont send a replacement poor seller,1
I love the way these headphones sound. The bluetooth connection is erratic. Sometimes perfect other times dropping every 10 minutes or pausing. If they didn't sound great I would return these. I have to call Sennheiser to see if they can trouble shoot,3
If you wear glasses you might want to pass on these.,1
"Great sound and easy setup. Noise cancellation works pretty well. Unfortunately the different modes are locked behind the Sennheiser app as far as I know, and the app is terrible.",5
"Sound feel so real in these headphones especially with wired connection. Definitely suggest this product who really enjoys good quality music. You won’t regret for the money spent on music quality., except battery life",4
Best sounding phones on the market with more than adaquate mood cancelling,5
"Sounds was amazing, microphone was too poor for work and phone calls. Noise canceling was good but could be better.",4
"Use it for TV listening.  Sound quality is OK, but not great.  Ambient sound control is on/off only (no volume control).  Unable to get cellphone sound through the earphones.  Overall, I'm not impressed.",3
I was more the pleased with these headphones. Sound quality blew me away.,5
"The sound quality of Sennheiser Momentum 3 is very good, the bass is strong, the mid-tone tone is also very pleasant, the treble is not harsh. The manufacturing quality is very good. It's great for listening to music and movies.",5
Best sound from a head phone I've ever heard. Had headphones from the 1970s till now. Listen to music  with it. Clean sound. Interments separation is superb. Great wearing comfort too.,5
"It was great except that it made my ears too warm. That doesn't bother a lot of folks, but I'm peculiar this way.",3
Hubby loves them but not all smart devices are compatible,5
Quite bulky. If you have a small head then they might look a bit silly. But the sound quality is incredible and well worth the purchase.,4
"Had to buy a microphone. However, the sound quality is really good!",5
I use these at work. Helps drown out noise in the office & lab. Auto-connect and auto-resume features are great! I love the materials.,5
Seems to have issues with initial connection. No matter what I do it makes a random popping noise. It's especially noticable during movies.,3
"Gift for my husband, he absolutely loves them",5
"Outstanding noise quality and app to customize EQ. Top notch sound, will not disappoint.",5
"The construction is one of the best as well as the sound, the only point to improve is the battery",4
Great Product,5
The noise canceling is terrible and poor battery life,3
these have incredible sound quality .,5
bruh gamestop naenaed some rich people's wallets bc they said something dum :o,5
these suck good for square big heads only,1
Some of the best sound quality you'll ever experience in an extremely well built package.,5
"Sound is amazing!! NC just OK! Battery life is fair!! All that being said, I really like them!!",5
So much better than my sony headphones which broke four times in the same place even after i replaced parts and treated them delicately,5
Ear muff arrived loose and then fell off. Cannot replace. Ergonomics are awful.,3
Super headphones with great sound.,5
Noise cancelling is just so so Great sound quality very detailed,5
Good,5
"Sounds amazing, n/c is good, very comfortable. A bit bulky but good fit!",5
Best headphones I've ever owned by far.,5
Supreme sound,5
"According to most professional reviews I've read (more than a dozen), these aren't the best in noise canceling, though a couple reviewers don't notice a difference with the best Sony or Bose, and they're improved over the Momentum 2. BUT some prefer the sound of the Sennheisers enough to more than make up for potential differences in noise cancelation. I haven't heard the others, but I do love the sound of these and find the noise suppression good enough. The sound (also reportedly improved over the 2) is clear and clean, detailed, with powerful, extended bass. The top end is handled in a way that makes them easy to listen to at any volume, even with material that isn't well recorded. That's a useful feature in phones sometimes used for resting. And the frequency balance can be (roughly) adjusted with the app. Along with my other comments I'm going to include a few not-very-technical explanations of technical points for those who may want them. These are Bluetooth 5 compliant (backward compatible) and can use aptX, aptX Low Latency, AAC, and SBC codecs for high quality sound and lack of delay. Noise canceling According to an engineer who has worked on it (quoted at soundstagesolo), standard active noise-canceling (ANC) works for low and low-midrange frequencies, below 1kHz. Noise isolation for upper-mids and highs, he says, is passive, i.e. good sound insulation. That may be why these phones cancel low-frequency noise impressively well, but higher frequencies somewhat less. In the default max cancellation mode, the sound from my TV's good external speakers is reduced from loud and full to something like a cell phone speaker several feet away, still quite audible if I don't have anything playing on the headphones. Similarly, standing next to a highway, traffic noise is nearly eliminated in the lows but still clearly audible, if much quieter, higher up. There's an anti-pressure ANC mode (accessed via the app) that's supposed to prevent the feeling of pressure in the ears some people experience with ANC (more below). It sounds similar to the max mode but with a little more mid-frequency sound coming through. And there's an anti-wind mode. It cuts lower-pitched wind noise better than the max mode, though some higher-pitched whistling sounds get through with both. For other kinds of noise it's less effective. (No) pressure According to the sound engineer, an abrupt transition between active and passive cancelation around 1kHz causes some people to feel a pressure sensation in their ears, which can be mild to painful. Many others don't feel it. (Theory and measurements suggest there isn't any change in pressure; it may be sound traits the brain interprets as pressure.) So there may be a tradeoff between cancelation and feeling pressure. The headphones with the maximum canceling right up to near 1kHz may cause the most pressure sensation. Those that taper off the ANC more gradually, and consequently let more sound in leading up to 1kHz, seem to cause less trouble. That may be why the anti-pressure mode on these lets more midrange sound in. But even the max mode seems not to bother people. I haven't seen any reports of people feeling pressure in the ears with the ANC on these headphones. Hear the Beard (sound quality) That's Dusty Hill's Beard. These are a bassist's dream, with strong extended bass, well into subwoofer range. (No loss of power at 20Hz, usually considered the lower limit of hearing. Sennheiser claims a remarkable 6Hz-22kHz range.) And it's clean and tight. I always evaluate headphones with a set of songs I know well, including ZZ Top's ""I Thank You,"" which has a prominent bass line from Mr. Hill. On these phones it throbs and pulses like with no others I've tried, but it's still in control, doesn't muddy up the song. The extended bass is especially satisfying with pipe organ music, where the pedal work is often only hinted at with other headphones. These rumble and growl as they should. It handles even the deepest rap beats with ease. Some people (not me) find the bass too much. They might want to use the EQ function (see below). The rest of the frequency spectrum is also clean, detailed, with good separation and soundstage. The top is lively but not hot. Sibilants aren't harsh, hi-hats sound natural. Like most headphones, they roll off some of the very highest sounds between 10-20kHz, some of which most of us can't hear anyway. That's generally for the best. These are more relaxed and less fatiguing than phones that don't roll off the very top. There's no distortion at extreme volume. They can get louder than I can listen to with most inputs, and no source I've tried has been too quiet to get the volume I want. EQ There's an equalizer function in the app. It doesn't allow fine control over any portion of the frequency range, but you can move a dot that adjusts the frequency-response curve to boost or lessen either or both ends or the middle. It's flexible and effective in a broad way, and easy enough. Once you adjust it, it stays that way until you change it. ANC sound quality ANC presents challenges for sound quality that some phones don't overcome well. With these the effect is small, usually unnoticeable even in a quiet environment. If I'm paying close attention, these sometimes sound a little more open and airy with ANC off. Isolation The closed design with thick ear pads that seal well means better isolation from others hearing what you're listening to, though they can still hear a little if they're close in. Transparent mode There's a button on the headphones for this. It's not quite like taking the phones off, but it's close enough to clearly hear others talking, TV, or whatever. Via the app you can set it so music stops in transparent mode, which is the default, or keeps going. Bluetooth Bluetooth connectivity is fine with my 2016 MacBook Pro, not so great with my 2011 MBP, where there's breakup and pausing after a while. With the latter, which I only use for sports video streaming (17""), I use the cable instead with no trouble. You can connect to two devices at once. Wired These come with a cable to use with a regular 1/8"" (3.5mm) headphone jack. For some music it sounds even better, a little cleaner and more open still. Mostly the sound is very similar as long as the power is on. With the headphones powered off (open while pushing the middle button), the sound isn't as good in my experience, but they're still usable that way in a pinch. Bluetooth is automatically disabled when plugged in, so you can't take or make calls. You can't use the music controls either. But you can still use ANC as long as the battery has power. If no battery power, you can still listen without ANC. Getting the plug in right on the ear cup was more difficult than it should be at first, but not hard now. You have to line up a tiny notch on the plug with a tiny protrusion on the jack and then push in and twist clockwise. The good part is that it stays in very securely. For some setups you can also get audio via the USB cable, though my Mac doesn't recognize it for that. Fit, physical comfort On my average-size male head the ear cups pressed tightly at first, but after some use and some very gentle headband stretching they became very comfortable. You can speed that up by keeping the ear cups spread across something the size of or a little larger than your head overnight. You need them to remain snug, though, so that they'll seal well. The ear pads are luxurious, supple leather over soft padding. They're very deep, so even though my ears stick out they don't get mashed down as they do with most headphones. The ear pads get a good seal with glasses. I've worn these for hours at a time without any discomfort from glasses. The headband has the same supple leather but with less padding, about 1/4"". The padding is a little over an inch wide at the top, divided into two ridges that run the length of the headband, probably cooler that way. As with most headphones, after a while I get a pain at the crown of my head and need to move the headband for a second, and then it's comfortable again. At just under 11 ounces these are 0.9 ounces heavier than Sony's WH-1000MX3 and 1.6 ounces more than Bose's 700. Buttons I'm not wild about touchpad controls on headphones, which tend to do things I don't want, so I'm glad these have buttons. They're easy to use, though it takes a little homework to learn all the ways to use them. There's one for ANC on/off and transparent mode. There are two for volume up and down and mic muting. Between the volume buttons is a ""multifunction"" button that controls music playback, phone functions, battery check, and opening without turning on. And there's a voice assistant button that also handles pairing and flight mode (Bluetooth off). There's no on/off button. They turn on when you open them, and go off when you close them. You can open them without turning them on by holding down the multi-function button while opening. Call quality I don't use these for calls, but I've noticed the professional reviews generally think they're good, with clear sound on both ends. A couple have found it sounds clear but a little distant to those on the other end. Battery life At 13-17 hours per charge with Bluetooth and ANC on (according to various tests), these don't offer as much as the nearest competitors, or the Momentum 2. You can quick-charge these for 10 minutes to get another 1-1/2 hours of use. It's 3 hours for a full charge. Unlike many competitors, you can still use these while they're charging. You can also use them without the battery like normal wired headphones, though you lose the ANC if the battery's dead. The battery isn't user replaceable, which is sadly the usual these days. Sennheiser says they'll replace it for a fee. A USB-C charging cable is included, with a USB-A adapter. Other points There's a Smart Pause feature that pauses music when you take the phones (or right ear cup) off. It can also take a call when you put the phones on, mute it when you take them off, and resume when you put them back on. Some people have found it may pause/mute if they turn their heads a certain way or even yawn. I turned it off in the app, as I usually don't want pausing. As mentioned above, you can open these without powering them on, by pushing the middle button while opening. TILE compliant, if you want to set up that app so you can find these when you lose them. NFC compliant. The app has been stable on my Android phone, but it doesn't always show the battery level. The case is nice but bulkier than it needs to be. I think I'll use a pouch instead. There are voice and tone prompts. You can turn either or both off with the app. There's a fairly detailed online manual. Warranty is two years, doesn't cover batteries or ear cushions (also replaceable). Designed and engineered in Germany, assembled in Romania.",5
"These sennheiser momentum Bluetooth wireless headphones are awesome! I’ll try to be as comprehensive as I can in this review, without boring you with “audiophile “ bs. First, they are made very well with leather ear cups and headband; this is typical Sennheiser quality.  The features are amazing. When listening to music, you can pause them just by lifting them off your head, and then when you put them back on, they automatically resume playing. To turn off, you simply fold them together, and a little voice says”power off”.  Pairing with my iPhone was ridiculously simple; I took them out of the box, unfolded them, and they instantly paired with my phone. I’ve never seen anything like that before. They have controls on the ear cup as well as the free app for your phone which instantly found the senns. Now for the sound. Just fantastic! The best I’ve heard,  and I’ve had a lot of headphones in my 75 years. Deep bass, and wonderful highs, just very musical.  The noise canceling is better than my Bose quiet comforts. Although the Bose are lighter, I prefer the Sennheiser. The one thing I don’t care for is the carrying case; it looks like a cake box. Comon, Sennheiser, you can do better than that!  There is no protection for the headphones in this, it’s very soft.  Otherwise, these are well made, quality, great sounding phones that are beautiful as well. I highly recommend! Ps just an update; these are not light weight, so I don’t know if ear fatigue will sent in during a long listening session. I will update",5
"Picked these up at BB - sorry its not verified, but i swear they are sitting on my desk right now. Its been along ANC BT journey for me - I started with the Sony's - every reviewer out there said it was the best for the money, best sound, best features blah blah blah.  I didnt find them particularly comfortable - the soundstage was just absent, it sounded like the music was coming from inside your head (thats a bad thing) - NC was the best, i will agree, but it added some weird pressure in my ears i just didnt care for - returned them as i just expected more from all these glowing reviews. Bought the bose 700 - uncomfortable from the start - headband to thin, silicone supported by air.  It hit the crown of my head kind of hard.  NC was good, not as good as sony - call quality was better than sony though. sound was also better - more impactful, much better soundstage, no sibilance detected - but the comfort killed me - returned them Went to BB to check out the px7 - right next to them was the momentum3.  They werent even on my radar, because i had the first pair of wired momentums years back, and they were too small for my huge ears.  I figure though, since im there, might as well compare the two.  Immediately i noticed that the sennheiser was quicker, explosive almost.  It was a little bass heavy, but its customizable in the app - px7 was also bass heavy, but it felt more bloated and its not customizable.  Music seperation was better, soundstage larger, mids a little pushed, but still sounded good.  Sounc quality the momentums had it.  Comfort was also best of the bunch.  Lambskin really is delightful.  It is hot, but its so comfy.  NC is NOT anywhere near the other 3 I mentioned, but it is serviceable on a train, just turned up the volume a little bit and was good.  better than nothing for sure. most of the issues people talked about before have been resolved with updates to the firmware of the device and of the app, BT issues, static issues with MBP, turning it on and off while keeping the headphones open.  All fixed.  This made me feel comfortable knowing that the team at Sennheiser is listening.  Overall, I recommend these over anything else.",4
"I ordered the 'New Sennheiser Momentum Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones with Auto On/Off, Smart Pause Functionality and Smart Control App' to review. So far, and after almost a month of testing and playing with these amazing headphones, I am ready to share my thoughts. First and foremost I must express that I am really disappointed in the case that Sennheiser has included with these ""High End""  Headphones. I mean come on Sennheiser. It seems pretty standard these days for higher end headphones to come with a nice clam-shell hard case. The case provided is a soft zipper pouch with little to no padding at all. I would not feel comfortable to stuff these into my backpack or even suitcase for that matter. Now with that said, these headphones ARE solid. The stainless steel headband is sturdy and not fragile. The headphones themselves are of a very nice quality construction with real leather, both on the headband and ear pads. The physical buttons (which I tend to like much better than the new ""touch"" buttons on some of the others out there) are nice and solid and function perfectly. The sound is absolutely AMAZING! I compared them to my wife's Bose QuietComfort 35 II headphones and honestly I love the sound signature on the Momentum's better. And as for the Noise Cancellation, I honestly can't tell much difference between the two. I do think the Bose do a slightly better job but for the sound quality you get out of the Momentum's, I'll stick with the Momentum's. As for the weight and comfort compared to the Bose, the Bose are lighter but not necessarily more comfortable. The Momentum's just feel SOLID. The Bose feel nice but light and flimsy. Other thoughts - Others complain about the ""auto pause"" feature on the Momentum's, but I personally love it. Others complain about the way you have to power these off by folding them up and personally, it doesn't bother me a bit. I would rather that then pressing a button and wondering if you pressed it correctly. This way, you KNOW they are off. Battery life isn't the greatest compared to many others in this price range but for me it's just fine. I don't travel long distances and for the occasional 5-6 hour flights I rarely take, they will give me what I need. Plus with the much appreciated USB type C charging port, they will charge pretty fast. Overall I LOVE everything about these, except for the soft flimsy case provided. Sound is fantastic! They are loud with rich thumping Bass, Nice clean Mids and wonderfully crisp Highs and for me the Sound Isolation works great.",4
"This pair of headphones is not going to be for everyone, but as I've learned while trying to find the ""perfect"" ANC headphones, no pair of headphones will be.  For me, the Momentum 3 is the best option out there and I will explain why below: Sound: I'll be honest, while I do care about ANC, sound is by far the most important aspect to headphones for me.  Yes, I want to block out noise, but I mostly use these in an office setting where even mediocre ANC and decent sound level will allow me to block out the world quite nicely.  That being said, this set of headphones has by far the best sound of any set of ANC headphones I've tried.  I have compared these against the HD1 wireless over ear headphones, B&O H9 3rd generation, Plantronics Backbeat Pro, Master and Dynamic MD60 wireless, B&W PX and PX7, Sony 1000MX3 and Bose 700. First, let me explain the sound of the Momentum 3's.  I would call it exciting.  It has just enough high end to include every detail of the music and a good deal of low so you also feel it.  The bass is boosted a bit but not overdone and does not drown out or distort vocals/highs/mids.  You can also adjust the EQ settings but in most cases I don't believe the they need any adjusting.  The clarity of these headphones is one of the key points I love.  When listening to a track like Chris Stapelton's Death Row, you can hear every detail like the picking of his guitar, the reverb from the bass, the breath between vocals, and other details that you won't hear even on other $4-500 headphones.  Listening to the Brett James version of ""stay with me"" on youtube with a full orchestra you can identify every instrument playing with clarity and it sounds amazing.  You feel like you are immersed in the music and the detail which is why I call the sound exciting.  While the highs are on full display with these headphones, they are not to the point of being shrilly like even the H9 3rd gens can do. Other than sound, the headphones have improved ear pads over the HD1's and are more comfortable.  I didn't know if I would like that they are a little bigger than the HD1's but it improves comfort.  I think they look much better than the HD1's but if you are a minimalist, you may like the M2 version better.  There is no physical power button which is very annoying.  The case does not hold them shut securely and if they aren't held shut they turn on.  So, I took the case from my HD1's which holds them shut and use the M3 case for my HD1's.  That solved the problem of them turning on when in transit and not being used.  I would really like a physical power button which they could solve with a software update.  The padding on top is 1000 times better than the lack of padding on the HD1.  Finally, I like the physical buttons but I preffered the slider type button for volume on the HD1 and the volume buttons are not differentiated enough so by tough it;s hard to tell if I'm on the top, middle or lower button.  These are annoying things but not annoying enough for me to pass up that sound.... Okay, here's my comparison to other headphones.  Disclaimer - we all have different tastes in sound and I think our ears can be tuned to certain sounds after time, so while this is based on my experience, if you have a different sound preference or your ears are tuned to more of a B&W house sound or a flat sound like the Audio-Technica M50's, you may think I'm way off.  So, this is based on my ears and listening preference, which is as much clarity as possible with enough bass to make me feel the music.  The Momentum 3's (M3's) are perfect for me this this regard. Beoplay H9 3rd Generation - I really wanted to like these better but the sound is much warmer and with nowhere near the clarity as the M3's.  Battery life on these is a great 30 hours but the touch controls are very wonky.  I often couldn't get them to work right and didn't use them.  I do really like how deep the bass gets on these, in fact if you are a fan of sub-bass, these are your cans, but that alone is not enough for me.  These completely lose the clarity and detail the M3's show.  If you prefer a warmer sound with deeper bass, you might like these better.  ANC on both of these are sub-par against Bose or Sony 1000MX3 but the sound is leaps and bounds better.  I prefer sound over ANC so I'd pick these or M3 over Bose or Sony.  These headphones look amazing, are built well and are very comfortable but every now and then my right ear rubs which is annoying Bowers and Wilkins PX and PX7 - I know people swear by this brand, but I have never been a fan of their sound.  I owned the PX wireless and wanted to love them, but they sounded tinny and the clamping force gave me headaches.  I listened to a set of the new PX7's but again, the sound was very warm and dull, not how I hear them often described.  I'm not sure if I've had 2 defective pair, but what I have tried rises nowhere near the level of a $400 set of headphones. Momentum 2/HD1 Wireless: These were my favorite set of headphones until I got the H9 3rd generations.  Between the H9 and these, they both have certain things they are very good at.  These have that clarity and detail I love but the bass can lack.  As noted above, the H9 lacks the detail and clarity but has that sub-bass, so I carried both these sets depending on what I was listening to and what type of experience I wanted.  IMO, the M3 negates the need to carry 2 sets as it covers what the M2's had and has great bass, even if not quite as deep as the H9's.  M2/HD1's did not have ANC that could be turned off and the top padding was horrible, but overall they were great headphones, folded up compact for travel, and had good sound and fine call quality for office use.  Not as great as the M3's though..... Master and Dynamic - I didn't spend too much time with these, but it took only a few minutes to realize these had a lot of detail on the high range and very flat bass.  These are tuned more towards the higher range or a flat EQ setup.  These just ooze quality, and they feel good on the head, possible better than the M3's, but I was not a fan of the flat EQ.  I didn't test ANC on these. Plantronics Backbeat Pro - while these are great headphones for the $1-200 range and do serve a purpose, they significantly lack the clarity the M3's have.  I didn't expect them to, and to be honest I'm not sure why I even included these, but if a person is looking for a cheaper set of ANC headphones with a lot of good features, these are a good set and worth mentioning. Bose 700/Sony 100MX3 - I put these in the same bucket because if you are looking specifically for ANC, you are going to disregard most of what I've written and go straight to one of these.  The ANC on either of these is the best of the bunch, but the sound lacks against the M3.  Sony IMO has better sound that Bose and possibly better ANC, but still does not hold a candle to M3's.  I would call the sound on these mediocre compared to the M3.  Battery on these is much better as well, so again, if you are a frequent traveler and want to fly around the world 3 times without recharging while hearing absolutely none of the outside world, then you are looking here and not the M3. Final verdict: As I stated at the beginning, I use these mostly in an office and not for traveling, so I'm much more concerned with sound that ANC or battery life.  These have by far the best sound out there, killing even the M2/HD1's.  ANC is mediocre but works fine for an office environment, I would really love a software update to allow one of the physical buttons to be used as an on/off switch, and the case that comes with it stinks (the HD1 case is way better so I switched them), but I still think they are fantastic headphones with killer sound.  In fact the best sound by far of any of the premium wireless headphones I've tried and that is what I focus on for my headphones.",5
"SOUND QUALITY - 10 stars with caveats As one would expect from Sennheiser the sound quality is of the highest quality. I am a classical listener. I want flat accurate reproduction. No pumped up bass, no clipping highs, extreme dynamic range, best quality channel separation (for genuine sound stage). The Sennheiser Momentum 3.0 give you all that, but with some severe limitations. BLUETOOTH - 2 stars The Bluetooth features are horrific. Granted, when connected to a decent telephone they perform well. They work well with my Galaxy Note 8.0. But they don't work well at all when connecting to a source with high level Bluetooth features, like Bluetooth HD. The absence of an app with the option to prioritize connection characteristics severely limits the ability to get the best sound. I prefer using a high quality dedicated DAC rather than the limited lower quality DACs in phones and tablets. The poor poor bluetooth implementation of the Sennheiser Momentum 3.0 means one cannot tap the full potential of the excellently engineered audio. It is sort of like setting up a dining table with the best china and flatware but only serving microwaved frozen entrees. The Sennheiser superior audio can only deliver superior sound if it gets a likewise superior signal, which these headphones are incapable of. WIRED MODE - 0 stars Like bluetooth Sennheiser misses the mark with the included (but limited) capability to use the headphones with a wired connection. Granted, many competitors don't allow a wired connection. But the Sennheiser feature requires a connector with a long enough slim shank to fit into the hole. Most 2.5 connectors will not work because the connector is recessed into a small hole. I have not found a manufacturer of high quality braided cables that can work with the Sennheiser recessed jack. Sure, there are other cables available, but they are no better quality that the cable that ships with the Sennheiser Momentum 3.0. Like the poor bluetooth implementation this means you cannot get the highest quality signal to the headphones. The bottom line about the Sennheiser Momentum 3.0 is they are very good for use with telephones, and they will shine in sound quality  compared with others in this class (Sony WH-1000XM3 and Bowers and Wilkins PX7 for example - there's probably a Bose model others would include but not me - Bose belongs in  lower class  - Perhaps ""elevator music headphones"") in that mode. But they totally fail to work as well as high quality audiophile grade headphones outside of the Phone arena.",3
"I bought these 1 month ago in a small shop - so now paid review or anything. Coming from the latest Sony NC headphones, I first gave the new Bose 700 NC a try, but ended up with the Sennheiser. In short: Sennheiser please keep on doing what you are doing - they sound amazing. Sure they are some shortcoming when it comes to ANC and battery life, but if you consider sound quality over everything else, give these a try! I had Sennheiser high-end bluetooth headphones a long time ago and was immediately hooked. When the ANC wave started I went for the Sony MDR-1000X. The ANC was great! I got used to the sound pretty quick and was satisfied. This year I wanted to replace them and went for the latest generation. Sound was very bass driven and didn't catch me.  I then bought the latest Bose 700. I have to admit the ANC features of both of them where impressive. The Bose are especially good with low frequent noise. However, sound was weird: mids where too dominant, not exciting, there was a lack of separation of vocals and instruments, and the worst is that the ANC cannot be switched off completely. You could turn it to ""0"" yes, but it still did something. To quote a good review of them: ""They sound like a nervous but kind waitress, who is new in the job: they want to do everything right and somehow manage to do so, but the next day you forgot about them.""  I wanted something more. A pair that I could also use at home with excellent sound. So I gave my old love Sennheiser a chance. First, some critics: - It is quite annoying that there is no physical on / off switch. One has to fold them to turn them off! (Tip: if you want to store them folded, you can do so, by pressing the play / pause button while unfolding them) - The bluetooth 5 features are faulty as with all the others: sure you can connect two devices at once. Nice. But try to switch between 3 devices. Everytime one has to bring the headphones to pairing mode and connect them, if the other known devices are in reach - The adjusting mechanism seems to loose grip over time, let see in a year or so - battery life: Compared to the competitors the subjective battery life is very poor. When the Sonys lasted around a week on my typical usage, the Sennheiser needed recharge after 4 days. Still okayish - ANC is by far not as good as the Sonys and not as good as the Bose. Still it will reduce a considerable amount of noise. I would say, the noise of speaking people around you is reduced similarly to the Bose, but low frequency noise not as good. I would say, they are on par with the first generations of Sonys MDR-1000X Now the good part: - The sound is amazing! You notice that the engineers at Sennheiser know what they are doing and what they want! Sound prioritized over everything. You can feel, that they first optimized sound that looked how they could do ANC without sacrificing too much. I think Sony and Bose did this the other way around and achieved in this way better ANC with compromises. - The separation of vocals and instruments is very good, which gives them a very broad and well balanced stage - They are very agile. The beat drives ahead, where the Sonys and Bose sound slow - The sound is quite balanced. The bass is strong when it needs to and very crisp. I listen mainly to Punk-Rock, but also like Hip-Hop, old Country, and movie soundtracks. And they manage all of this really good. - With AptX and AptX low latency, they have perfect protocols that ensure almost no lack when watching movies - The App is decent and works, but the best is: you don't need it at all! (pointing at Bose ...) - Build quality is really really good. Basically what you would expect from a German based company Overall I am very satisfied with these. I had the feeling some of the reviews where a bit off, because one needs to understand the philosophy behind the product. Sure, these are not the best ANC headphones on the market, but if you don't put them in the same corner as the other headphones (unfortunately I could not try the B&W P7X yet), and one looks for superior sound quality, one should definitely give them a try.",5
"This is mainly a comparison with the prior version in the range, the Momentum 2 (aka M2). PROS +  Better sound, particularly in the treble range.  The M2 was a little too dark. +  Exciting bass response.  Big, bold, and better defined than the M2. +  Far more comfortable than the M2.  More roomy ear pads/cups. +  Soundstage is much better vs. the ""in your head"" sound of the M2. +  BT 5.0 +  USB C +  Good tactile feedback from rubberized buttons. +  Ambient Mode can be quickly activated with just a flick of the switch. CONS -  Plastic ear cups feel cheaper and seem to be of a lower grade plastic than the M2. -  Sliders are not as smooth as the M2.  The adjustment feels a bit rough and not as smooth as the M2. -  Soft-ish case.  A full hard case for a product costing $400 would have been nice. -  ANC is OK.  Does not completely kill out the portable space heater noise in my office (the Sony XM3 eliminates it completely). In short, everything was improved, except for the build quality, which is still good, but not better than the M2 (although comfort is superior).  For $400, I would have liked to see a clear upgrade in all areas over the M2. BOTTOM LINE PROS outweigh the CONS.  If you want top-tier sound in a portable wireless headphone, but can forego top-tier ANC, these are a great buy.  If you want the best ANC, go for the Sony XM3, which still sound good, but don't sound as good as these.",4
"I've used several Bluetooth Bose headsets over the years, and I've used several pro audio headsets by Sennheiser as well - My hope was that this might be the best of both in one headset. Unfortunately - you would be much better off getting an older pair of Bose headphones for noise cancelling/casual use/teleconferencing, and getting a cheaper, wired set of pro audio headphones for music production as the Momentum 3 ultimately fails at both things Pros: - Sound quality is excellent (can get a punchy Beats-style sound on Bluetooth with tweaking on the app or kept pretty accurate while in wired mode for real audio work) - I prefer the aesthetics compared to the more generic Bose/Sony/Beats designs - Very comfortable for all day use with deep ear cups and soft pads - USB-C for charging and connection is nice - Noise cancellation is pretty good and can be customized on the app. I actually prefer the Sennheiser cancellation to the older Bose QC3 though I don't use this feature on a daily basis Cons: - the auto-pause feature never worked for me - it kept pausing randomly and had to be turned off in the app - Bluetooth connectivity is unreliable compared to Bose - keeps dropping me or sometimes just won't connect at all. This really brings it down in overall value for me. - the auto off feature when you close the headphones becomes very annoying when you're constantly having to turn them on and off try to reconnect to your device. I wanted to like this - but a switch would have been better - wired connection uses the stupid tiny jack instead of the much more common 1/8"" minijack and as a recessed port with a locking mechanism so you can't use a converter. Another fail in the Pro audio department - the sliding mechanism that allows the earcups to go up and down should be tighter or have an adjustment - as far as I can tell it only uses Alexa? never really looked into that much though Mixed: - Battery life is less than my old Bose headphones, but these charge faster with USB-C so it's a draw there I guess? The excellent sound quality makes this headset all the more frustrating since all the other features are garbage. I'll continue to use Sennheiser pro audio - but they have a lot of work to do before they can compete in the casual audio market",2
"Do not buy, no way to repair after warranty and batteries die.",1
"I like these headphones very much and they have become my ""go to"" set. I have been using them daily to listen to music of all kinds as well as the spoken word. I guess a total of about 30 hours of use with 320k MP3s and a few FLAC files as well as some Youtube videos. I'm not an ""audiophile,"" and I don't know if there's anything to the headphone ""break-in"" argument or not, but I first played a pink noise loop through them for perhaps a 100 hours just in case. Everything seems clear and undistorted with no break up or rattling at high or low frequencies. They give a very even performance across the audio spectrum except for a bump in the low bass and a sharply defined dip in the mid treble at around 4K (you can see the curve at the soundguys website). I prefer a flat audio response curve so I equalized both of these. Most of my listening is on my smartphone with Poweramp V2 which has an excellent 10-band equalizer. Just a few dB down in the low bass and a couple of dB up near mid-treble. Minor but I think necessary to avoid head-thumping bass and pushing female vocalists to the back of the soundstage. They are noise-cancelling headphones, but the soft leather ear cups do an excellent job of sealing out the rest of the world so nothing interferes with whatever you're listening to without any other intervention. I use them mostly when things are quiet at home or when I'm out walking. In the  first case, I don't need ANC and in the second, I don't want it. The headphones seem well-made. They are comfortable to wear though a little heavy (on my kitchen scale they are 10.75 oz). Unlike other headphones I've seen, they are understated and unobtrusive in appearance--flat black with silver trim. Bluetooth works reliably for me. And the Sennheisers support having 2 remembered sources which autoconnect whenever the headphones power up. There is a Sennheiser app that you can download from the Google store. I used it to turn off the auto-pause feature every time I remove the headphones from my head. If you need an equalizer, there is one there as well. Controls are excellent. Play/pause/phone, Volume up/down, ANC mode and Pairing. There is no power on/off however. You do that by folding/unfolding the headset. I walk every day for exercise 2 to 3 miles. I think these would be too hot in the summer, so I'll probably stick to my Koss Porta Pros in warm weather. But these Sennheisers are my new daily companions otherwise.",5
"I expected to be blown away by the Sennheiser Momentem wireless headphones simply because it’s a brand that’s supposed to be top notch. However I feel you’re paying for the name & all the cool features rather than sound quality. The features sure are nice though, you can pause a song by simply pulling off your headphones, you can also power off by folding them closed. They pair immediately with your phone, like automatic. They’re obviously built very well which I expect from a brand like Sennheiser, they’re comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, the ear cups are genuine leather I believe. These are obviously very premium in build quality & features but the sound could be better. For the price, i believe they’re are better options. Overall they’re nice headphones just doesn’t match with it’s price point. I probably wouldn’t order again.",3
"These sound amazing. They are comfortable. I love the brand and have some of their other products. This would be a 5 star review - BUT these can't be charged with any old USB C cable - only the one in the box. My apple computer USB C cables won't charge them. I spoke to tech support and these headphones can't charge with a USB C cable that can also carry data! Bose, B&W, Sennheiser's earbuds - no problem. These - no good. So this is a shocking flaw and a real disappointment. I'm hoping they can fix with firmware.",2
"I have long been a fan of Sennheiser products. Doing film / live TV audio work, we always had Sennheiser wireless mics and headphones. My favourite set of headphones is an old pair of corded Sennheiser headphones that I cannot bear to part with. That's why when Amazon was offering a pair of their Momentum Wireless Noise Cancelling headphones through Vine, I jumped at the chance. The sound is great. They last a really long time on a single charge. The noise-canceling function is great, and for the most part, I was impressed.  I did subtract one star from my review because for whatever reason during a playback on some film that I know had great sound, they would cut out either intermittently or entirely. I tested it on two different BlueTooth devices and the same thing happened. Sennheiser, as a rule, is not cheap equipment. When you make the kind of investment in a piece of equipment, you expect it to work 100% of the time.",4
"I currently own the HD1 wireless edition (both in black/ivory).  I was an early adopter of the BT Momentum HPs when priced @ 500.00 USD. The 3rd edition’s over-engineered: 1) Removed the tactile on/off button; this is a functional misstep for obvious reasons 2) Redesigned the headband fold down mechanism; this causes physical finger pinch points when collapsing the headset to shut it off (mandatory to power it off). 3) The playback on the redesigned headset is intermittently interrupted due to head movement; the sensors are hyper reactive causing pauses during normal playback. 4) ANC has various modes of filtering; many of which are indistinguishable; a simple toggle on/off would offer less complex engagement by the user 5) The design of the new model loses the retro & nostalgic build of the timeless classic that preceded it; the new model’s bloated in every way (over engineered features that take a step backwards in simple function ) vs. the nimble straight forward design of the elegant older unit.  Ex.  The split leather headband design, with stitched details, is tossed out completely in favor of a chunky headband that has none of that unique flare.",1
"This Headphone works very well with my iPhone 6+.  I was surprised that it interacted so well.  After pairing it with the phone, just unfolding and putting in on my head made the two work together again.  The headphones were comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  The sound quality was better than my ears.  On the downside, I tried to use it with my Windows 10 PC and intially, I was quite happy.  I paired it with the computer and it showed up on the options to select and everything sounded good.  But then for some unknown reason, it decided it would rather play music from my iPhone.  Unlike the iPhone, there doesn’t seem to be an app that goes with this headset.  I assume this would work with an Andoid based phone as well since there is an app for that.  I can’t test that.  This is definitely a premium set of headphones.",4
"The sound quality on these headphones is by far the best I’ve tried, especially if you enjoy deep bass, and the app has two versions of the equalizer so you can adjust the sound to your liking. There can be some distortion in the bass at top volume but these headphones get very loud so there’s no need to have the volume set all the way to max. You can even name and save up to 9 (I believe) EQ settings to switch easily based on musical genres. The build quality is top notch but I do think they can look a little goofy from the front. I also think the Sandy White color looks more striking than the black but I still like both. Battery life isn’t great, no, but considering the sound output they have I’m not really surprised I guess. The auto-pause feature does work well but you need to be sure they are fitted tightly to your head, if the fit is too loose they can register false pauses if you tip your head the wrong way (but this hasn’t happened often to me so it’s not a deal-breaker by any means). You can always turn the auto-pause/auto-play feature off using the app. Also, I agree the noise canceling is not the best here, but again, the sound quality makes up for any deficiencies in that department. In addition I really like that you can use the usb-c cable to plug into a computer or as in my case my iPad Pro and not only get amazing sound for watching video or listen to music but they will charge at the same time (of course this will drain battery from my iPad as well). I have compared a number of wireless headphones lately and these have the best sound quality without a doubt. The new Sony XM4’s are a close second for sound but win for noise canceling and features as well as  battery life (although they don’t seem to come close to the 30 hours advertised). I bought these when they were on sale directly through Audio 46 and I highly recommended them (both the headphones and Audio 46) especially if you can find the headphones on sale! One more thing I forgot to mention: the auto power off/on when you fold/unfold always works perfectly and the Bluetooth connection is super fast. They will connect to two devices simultaneously but this feature seems kind of buggy to me (switching back and forth somewhat randomly) so I usually leave this feature off unless I have a direct reason to have the two connections active Also, I’ve not used the headphones for calls as of yet, so I cannot attest to the quality in that area.",4
"Pulled the trigger on the Sennheiser Momentum 3’s last week, bought directly from their website.  Decided on the white-sand hue, looks pretty sleek and my decision based off Comfort, ANC, ease of use for multipurpose – work, personal, gaming. Took a boost in the comfort department, the larger ear cups are great, it hasn’t generated too much heat to make it uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, I think there is a slight loss on noise cancellation.  My neighborhood has seen an increase in barking dogs or lawn care maintenance and it is much more noticeable when WFH.  I think these will help, but won’t make a dramatic difference. With larger ear cups that have plush leather(?) are comfortable wearing them over glasses. The exterior ends feel well constructed and are held together by the metal/leather connector. I had been hesitant to get wireless ANC headphones for a long time because I’ve read complaints that the frequency agitates migraines/headaches from those that experience them.  The ANC does give me some pressure during extended use.  No migraines yet and I knew going into this market it could happen. I doubt many folks will experience a similar issue. The connectivity to 2 devices and swapping seemed pretty snappy after a firmware update to 4.xx.  The app itself at times says it doesn’t connect but it does when I go through the prompts.  You’ll see 3 different ANC options and the EQ is neat for tweaking to your liking. Getting to work on a PS4 was a bit of a trial by error hassle but works fine with a Bluetooth dongle or using the aux cable to the controller.  You can also pair with the V-MODA BoomPro Microphone, I haven’t tried this setup but anticipate it working as other reviews have said.  The Bluetooth dongle is the BTD800 that comes with their newer WFH headsets. The product manual even references BTD800 but I couldn’t find one for sale as a separate unit, amazon stocks BTD500 but I’m concerned those codecs are not sufficient for newer wireless headphones.  It might work with other dongles but be cautious of the codec and latency from third parties. The USB dongle tricks the console into having a USB headset from the controller.  I synced up the dongle/M3 on my computer for ease then transferred to PS4.  Worked really well playing Uncharted 4, the sound was superb compared to my 2010 Vizio 2.1 soundbar.  I really appreciate the immersion(?) from across the environment.  Clean, crisp, and sharp.  The auto pause is a bit weird.  If you move your neck a certain way, it does pause the audio for a moment.  Haven't found it bothersome yet to turn the feature off but that is something to keep in mind. BT with Alexa worked great and also synced quickly. I streamed music from TuneIn, set a few alarms, listened to the daily flash briefing, and made a phone call. The commands worked just as good compared to the Alexa physical device.  I don’t recall any noticeable pauses between prompts.  Called my grandmother with the headset connected via phone and she said call quality was good.  The mic was determined audible, maybe slightly quiet but well enough for an 80yr old without any hearing issues to understand. Battery life is not great but wasn't a major concern for me.  The app will tell you remaining power. Charging can be done unfolded or folding the opposite ear piece in first.  Also, if you hold the play button down for 5 seconds it will turn the headset off.  I like how the buttons are not flush and recognizable by touch.  The max/min volume setting doesn’t become the extreme of either. I found it odd the max/min warning is actually louder then the content you’re listening to.  The sound feels a bit soft, maybe that is considered a safe ‘loud’ setting but not amplified enough to be deafening.  Seems reasonable any ways, possibly I’m losing my hearing too. All in all, great purchase.  Tough to give it 5 but it checks most of the boxes for 4 out of 5.",4
"Wow! is all I have to say. Let's cut right to the chase these are the best wireless headphones you will ever buy in terms of sound quality. The sound quality is so amazing that no other headphones will ever sound the same again. Also, the sound quality is so great it's like hearing your favorite song for the first time every time you listen to it through these headphones, I'm not kidding I recognize different notes and tones every time and when I do I always say to myself these headphones are amazing. The look and feel of these headphones are great as well, very comfortable for all day use, I own the Sandy Whites and they just look sexy. Let's get to the negatives, ANC is good but not great and battery life is not bad I wish it lasted a bit longer, the carrying case looks great but it's not, wish it was a hard case. I've owned every headphone you can think of but I'll take the sound quality of these over any others. I gave my Sony's away to my brother after buying these, it's not that the Sony's are not great either it's just these sound better and the Sony's didn't sound the same to me anymore after these Momentums. It also depends what your looking for in your headphones because they are all just about even with slight differences. If ANC is what your looking for look elsewhere ""Sony's"", if Battery life is what your looking for don't look here ""Sony's"". If you want something in-between all 3 go with Bose. However, if sound quality is your choice which it should be than you've come to right place these are the ones I'm telling you. If your nervous about the price don't be, these are worth every penny.",5
"If you’re looking for over the ears Noise Cancelling Headphones at a reasonable price there are 3 top performers without breaking the bank.  They are as follows as rated by Sonic Quality: #1 - Sennheiser Momentum 3 #2 - Sony WH-1000XM3 #3 - Bose QuietComfort 35 II * The Sony is much closer to the Sennheiser’s over the Bose in this matching. Rated by Noise Cancelling: #1 - Sony WH-1000XM3 #2 - Bose QuietComfort 35 II #3 - Sennheiser Momentum 3 * The Bose and Sennheiser are very close in this matching. Rated by features: #1 - Sennheiser Momentum 3 #2 - Sony WH-1000XM3 #3 - Bose QuietComfort 35 II * The Sony and Bose are close to the same. I’ve owned all of the Sennheiser Momentum’s, the first offering, the M2 AEBT which I still own, and now the 3’s.  The first two generations were very similar, identical in features but better sound quality with the M2 series.  The biggest issue with the first two generations was a lack of bass depth, good crisp bass but not as full as the new 3’s which makes them a good competitor with the WH-1000XM3’s. Another plus with the Momentum 3 is the earcup controls, they’ve added 3 more controls, Up & Down Volume buttons, and a Dedicated Control for the Noise Cancelling Features which can make your headphones like an open ear headset as well as two NCF modes.  If you are upgrading from either of the other two versions it takes a little bit to get use to the extra controls but once you do, you’ll probably like them even more. The NCF is well improved over the previous versions and it’s really nice having more control over modes you listen in. One down-side to GEN 3 is they are heavier due to the larger drivers which makes them less comfortable then the previous versions, they are still very comfortable after they get broken in, soften up some. I see a noticeable improvement compared to the Momentum & Momentum M2 and I don’t regret purchasing the new Momentum 3’s, well worth every penny it costs.  On sale you can get both Sony and Bose cheaper than the Sennheiser’s and if you are on a budget that makes the Momentums a tough choice. Fortunately, either the Sony or the Bose should make you happy, if I didn’t get the Momentum’s I’d go with the WH-1000XM3’s.",5
"I purchased Sandy white M3s earlier this year, and sad to say I should've returned it in the 30 day window. This wasn’t my first purchase as I bought PXC550 in February of 2019 from Sennheiser’s amazon account (which got stolen) and HD 200 Pro in April of 2018 directly from Sennheiser’s website, so I was confident that I’d be getting a quality product despite the high price tag. I've preferred Sennheiser over ear headphones over the other varieties I had tried in a similar price range and found subpar in comparison: this had been true since I had gotten a pair of hand-me-downs of Momentum 2s in mid 2010s. I was originally planning on buying pxc550 ii but I thought I’d give a different model a try—especially because that other model (M3s) seemed more aesthetically pleasing, came with a USB-C charging port, and large ear cups. Surely, I thought, the audio quality would be as good if not better than older and (now) cheaper PXC 550s. Boy was I wrong. I feel embarrassed for not having returned the Momentum 3s when I had the chance: I thought I just had to “break them in” so they could achieve their full potential so I hung on to them past the return window. Having had them for several months, I can assure you they do not get any better. I hoped maybe a firmware update would help, but alas, none thus far has made the pair sound nearly as nice as the old PXCs. No setting seems to help on the app. I understood the battery life may have been shorter, but I get nowhere close to 17 hours. I am lucky to get 10 hours of use, and that’s on medium volume and ANC on (high): with ANC off, it’s closer to 12 hours! Additionally, in person, these do not look nearly as aesthetically pleasing as an older pair of Momentum 2s I was handed down. I am terribly disappointed. I don’t mind spending good money for a quality product, but I feel swindled with this purchase. Currently, I can’t, in good faith, recommend any other Sennheiser products to anyone other than the ones I have had personal positive experiences with. I hope that my experience isn’t reflective of a broader negative trend associated with the company’s values. Save your money. Buy a like-new used pair of PXC550s on the used market (for like $70!) or try your luck with the Sony XM4s. I'd be happy to answer any questions.",2
"This review is for the Momentum Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones with Auto On/Off, Smart Pause Functionality and Smart Control App.  I wanted a set of headphones that would be comfortable for me to wear for a few hours with good sound quality.  These headphones are very comfortable for me to wear for 3-4 hours and the sound quality for me has been very good. I have not had any popping noises mentioned in other reviews. I have to say at this point however that I have paired these headphones with a Lenovo combination laptop/tablet (running Windows 10) and not a smartphone.  The ANC (Automatic Noise Cancelling) works okay for me, but could perhaps be better. I believe the volume of the background noise is probably the biggest factor on how well the ANC works for you.  The higher the volume of the background noise the less effective the ANC feature will be.  Playing a radio in the background with nothing playing on the headphones I would say the ANC feature cut the volume of the background noise in half, maybe a little more than half. I had no problems at all pairing these headphones with my combo laptop/tablet (Windows 10).  One strange thing is that when I activate these headphones the headphones say ""Power On Phone 1 Connected.""  I have had no problems fully charging the battery in these headphones. I give these headphones 5 stars for comfort, 5 stars for sound quality (and volume), 3 stars for ANC.  Easy to pair. Construction is solid. I give 4 stars overall.",4
"These headphones have great sound quality if you EQ them with the included app to add more high end treble. Some problems with these headphones are that the earpads aren't deep enough so your ears touch the inner lining of them which gets annoying. They are too heavy, they should be be lighter like the Bose QC35. The earpads should have angled interiors so the rim of your ear doesn't touch like the QC35 has. I have an iPhone X and almost every time I reopen the sennheiser control app after I close it, it doesn't recognize the headphones anymore and have to try to reconnect it. This doesn't affect the actual connection through bluetooth but it does affect your ability to change settings for the headphones through the app. The design of the headphones could be more streamlined too, get rid of the metal bands that allow the headphones to adjust. This will reduce weight and also not make the headphones so wide on your head. The great thing about these head phones is the detail in the high end and the musicality of the bass. I haven't had a pair of headphones yet that has the same musical nature the bass has on these. It sounds more visceral like you're hearing the real instrument. Sennheiser please on the next iteration of these: -Reduce the weight -Make them more streamlined like the Bose QC35 - Make the earcups larger and deeper with an angled interior so ears don't touch - Update the app so it stops disconnecting from my phone constantly - Update the EQ on the app so we can adjust each frequency band instead of a slider that is rudimentary - Make them in different colors",3
"Got these hoping they'd close the sound quality void I've always felt in the Sony WH-1000M3 and Bose QC 35 II. I own both headphones, and they're excellent at what they're made for - really great (but not amazing) sound, excellent battery life, and noise cancellation to blow your mind. I also own a few Audiophile-grade wired headphones, and always hoped someone would launch a wireless pair that met a reasonable bar for sound quality given the constraints of wireless noise cancelling cans. The Sennheiser Momentum 3s are by far the best sounding wireless headphone you can find; however, the audio superiority is seriously undermined by the poor design and even worse app. Design -  The clamping effect is very strong to the point of being painful; the pads feel high quality, but for some reason are super uncomfortable, and get really hot and sweaty 30 mins into playback. The twisted, exposed wires also look a bit odd; the metal ends of the headphones are a bit sharp and can easily graze the leather pads when folding if you're not careful. App - This was the biggest source of disappointment and frustration, and was the final dealbreaker for me. Here's why - the headphones sound fairly neutral and muddy right out of the box; you need the adjust the equalizer in the app to get it tuned to your preferences. Once you get it right the headphones sound truly incredible; best I've heard in a wireless set of cans; however, for some reason, it did not save the equalizer preferences and kept reverting back to the muddy setting whenever the app was closed or sent to the background.  When connecting to my Macbook Pro, the equalizer settings did not work at all; it was factory default settings only. The overall design shortcomings (while aesthetically pleasing) and the poor app performance made this a dealbreaker for me. I'm back with the Sony and Bose cans, keeping my eye out for future launches that raise the bar for sound quality.",3
"These headphones sound great. Better than most of the noise cancelling headphones on the market, which is expected - they are Sennheiser. Sennheiser makes all kinds of headphones, but even at the lower levels they put an emphasis on sound quality. These being a higher end headphone, they sound really good. The touch controls on the side take a bit of getting used to, but are really handy. I wish there was  skip forward or back, but having the quick 'active listening' switch so you can hear just your surroundings for a minute is really cool. The noise cancelling is not as good as Bose, but the headphones sound richer and fuller (to me) than the Bose and all but really loud sounds are cancelled out. In a work environment, they are perfect. On an Airplane, I am not 100% sure they would block out the engine noise but they probably would. The feature to turn stop the music when you  take them off is really great too, but can be sensitive to turning your head. You sometimes get stopped music if you turn too far to either side. Battery life is really great. I use them for a few hours each day of a week and charge them once a week. They charge pretty quickly too. I usually charge them before I go into a meeting or lunch and they are full in an hour or so (maybe 2 tops). All in all, if you want great sound and decent noise cancelling you cannot go wrong here.",4
"The sound quality on these is excellent across the board: *high definition: you will hear every detail from breathing and clothing moving, to the sound of a violin stroke changing direction in the orchestra *powerful bass: listening to a deep beat is excellent with these *crisp treble: not tinny, just crisp and clear The smart pause stops your music when you take the headphones off, so interruptions don’t make you lose your place, whether for podcasts or music. Pairing was easy, and there are lots of controls on the headphones so you can use them for calls, Siri, dictation, etc.. USB-C: these headphones are compatible with my new MacBook pro, but if you do not have anything with USB-C, this includes an adapter for USB-C to standard USB. The last thing one wants to do is drop more money just to charge these, so it’s good they included this to make it portable and usable. Speaking of portability, the carry case is soft, which means it won’t protect the headphones well. This looked cheaper than I expected, especially considering that I own significantly cheaper headphones than these with a better case. It might seem petty to point this out, but part of having noise cancelling headphones is usually because you travel and want to block the noise of an airplane, train, or ship engine out. If the case isn’t good for travel, then it’s a problem, and you have to figure out another way to pack these, whether that means buying something that is not a great fit for the size, or just risking it.",4
"My first wireless, noise-cancelling headphones, after using wired hi-fi headphones for a while. My first impression was that these were comfortable and nice, sounded alright, but the auto-pause feature was killing me. It would pause when I was simply walking around and doing something with them on, trying to use the luxury of wireless. But you need to download the app, and in the settings there you can disable the auto-pause along with the annoying voice and opt to only have the little beeps to indicate volume up and down etc. Making them a lot nicer, and actually just really really nice.",5
"I decided that I was either going to get the best new Sony or Bose headphones. Then it hit me... I really love the sound that comes out of all of the Sennheiser products I've owned. So, this model may not look as sleek as others, but the sound is incredible! I compared Sony, Bose, and these, and the Sennheiser Momentum won! I'm a stickler for great audio, and these headphones definitely deliver. Highly recommended.",5
"I bought a pair of these at a local chain retailer. I really like Sennheiser headphones, so getting these made a lot of sense. Unfortunately, they are very buggy where certain apps stop working, even though you can see the UV/Volume indicator moving but no sound. Then to get those apps (not all of them, some still work), you need to repair the headset to get sound again. Reboots dont work, toggling bluetooth, etc. you have to unpair and repair to get working sound in like 50% of your desktop applications. I'd love these if they just worked 90% of the time, but I'm debating returning them for Bose or another high end brand due to the annoyances.",1
"The sound is great. My first impression was ""surround sound"". I know that sounds dumb. But. I have the momentum 2.0, and the sound quality is in different leagues. My huge negative. The reason why I may return these is because of the mute function. More specifically to when I'm on a phone call and walking. The mute function toggles on and off incessantly. And if I can manage to stop it from repeatedly saying ""mute on"" and ""mute off"", the other person is muted. Or my mic is muted. It's maddening. The other problem, is when I'm on a video call, and I don't have the headphones on, but decide mid-call to out them on. They will not pair, but will keep saying ""phone call ended"", and will never pair with the video chat. I've had these for a few days, so maybe there is something I'm doing wrong, but. I am very near to returning these.",2
"These headphones sound great. The bass is powerful and thumps, but to a tasteful degree. Mids seem pretty much neutral. The treble is detailed and there is a decent amount of ""air"" and ""sparkle"". The soundstage is pretty wide considering the fact that these are ANC headphones. Speaking of, the ANC is pretty good. Not the best, but definitely does a good job on cutting out most of the noise around me. They are pretty comfortable too. So far my favorite noise-cancelling headphones and I have tried a lot of different ones: Bose QC 35-II and NC 700; WH-1000XM4 and XM3; Bowers & Wilkins PX and PX7. These stand above the rest because of how they sound to me.",5
"These headphones sound amazing.  They're very comfortable.  The quality build is obvious. The constantly dropping Bluetooth, however, negates all of the positives.  Sadly, they're going back.",1
"Surprisingly I Love their sound!!! Well, first my skull crushers ANCs power button broke I also tried the new Sony xM4s  and they were junk compared to these....I returned the Sony's in one hr😂😂",5
No Amazon payment plan on these....heck no I'll go with the Bose...,2
These headphone sound amazing and would be a great headset if not for the glaring design flaws. The wired mode does not work with out battery and removes a lot of the benefit of having a wired connection. There is no on off switch and my headset is stuck in wired mode preventing me from ever using it wireless ever again.,2
Was skiing with these in the main pocket of my backpack when i fell 10 feet onto my back. That wreck broke 2 of my ribs. Headphones were unscathed. Enjoyed their use on the way home. Sound quality is great. 5/5 Would land on again,5
These headphones emit a deafening sound when you take them off. I told the company and ask for a replacement and they don’t even respond. This is the worst company I have ever bought from.,1
"super comfortable, premium materials. got these to replace B&W PX7, which were too tight and gave me a headache.",5
"Great sound quality, crap software",3
"These are comfortable overear headphones. The earcups are made of sheepskin, and the outter plastic is of great quality. The rails the headphones slide up and down for a customizable fit are a nice touch as well. Buttons are distinct but could use a bit better travel. The earcups are deep and haven't heated up for me while in use this summer. They support SBC, AAC, APTX-LL and APTX. This give them the ability to do justice to well mastered recordings whether local or streamed files. I do wish they had LDAC or APTX-HD however. Also for watching movies or shows thanks to APTX-LL on compatible Android devices, the latency of audio and video stays in sync with services like prime Video, Disney plus hulu, Netflix and youTube TV. noise canceling blocks low whirring of AC units pretty well, but not the mid range sound of the AC fans, nor conversations. an update via the smart control app improves ANC however. That same update also changes the EQ from a dot which you move around the screen to a 3 band eq that addresses bass, mid and treble. These headphones would benefit from a 5 band eq at minimum, but this 3 band option is so much better than the dot Sennheiser has given for altering the sound to your preferences. out of the box, the sound is boomy like the Momentum line is known for, but much more controled than previous momentum headphones, and not muddy like it's predecessors. These at least have a distinct midrange and a rolled off but present treble. But the bass can be reduced, and treble brought forward, and you don't lose the incredible wide soundstage these bring to the table. They also have solid placement of instruments and separate the mix nicely. Assistent works well with these also, and calls are best in class. i tested these while having a conversation using a shop vacuum, with loud airplane noise from my speakers, rattling plastic bags and crunching paper, going outside with traffic, with water running etc. There were instances like with the airplane noise at loud volumes where it was sometimes difficult for people to hear me, but i was never muffled completely. They could always understand what i said. I tested these for range including for calls by leaving my phone in a corner of my apartment and also carrying it with me, as these are real world use cases. You also have the benefit of hearing what's around you while on calls piped in and you can hear your own voice well, keeping the conversation at a normal level and not creating a scenario where you might feel the need to shout to be heard. The transparent hearing mode on these is natural and at a great volume. battery life could be longer, but at least they hold their battery so it's ready when you are. They also autopause when removed from your head or even by removing 1 earcup. The case they come with is nice feeling, but i wish it were thicker. i don't feel like it will tear, but many cases even smaller ones offer better protection. To turn these on you unfold them and reverse to turn them off. Keeping them folded insures they won't power on, but unfortunately theres no way to lock these cups into place. An update also provides the option to disable autopause and power the headphones down by holding down the multifunction button. Controls are along the back edge of the right earcup. the previously mentioned multi function button also answers and ends calls with 1 press, a press and hold rejects the call, 1 press for play-pause while listening to music, to to skip ahead, 3 to go back, and 2 taps and a hold to scrub forward through a track and 3 presses and a hold to go backward through a track. Theres the button to toggle between ambiant, ANC and normal modes and the assistent button. These Momentum 3 are refreshing, after the momentum 2. They're built better, sound objectively is much improved and so is functionality across the board. There aren't as many Bluetooth overear headphones released as there has been previously, but in the last year we have seen several new entrants and successors to previous models. The Sennheiser Momentum 3 is not only better than the original, but it stands up well to the competition and is a compelling option for people who like a clasic headphone look, great sound and call quality and need ANC as a bonus.",5
"The Momentum 3's are a great option for those who value sound and build quality over ANC (and battery life). To start with the cons, I would characterize the ANC on the M3's as average at best, and without question inferior to the consensus top choices in this segment (the Sony XM3's and Bose 700's). Battery life in the M3's is also worse than the aforementioned pair. The M3's make up for this with great sound and excellent build quality. Looks are subjective but I personally think these look great, and the sheepskin leather on the earcups and headband feels fantastic to the touch. The M3's are a little heavy after a while but I personally find them comfortable. Your mileage may vary depending on the dimensions of your head of course. On the whole they feel sturdy and well built. I also think the M3's sound great, better than the Sony and Bose. While a bit bassy out of the box (I turned down the base a bit with the EQ), the soundstage is wide with great clarity and instrument separation. Now, these almost certainly won't sound as good as say, the HD600's, but listening to the latter on the subway or the library is probably a bad idea. As wireless closed back headphones go, these sound fantastic. Ultimately, if you prefer the mix of Great Sound and OK ANC vs Good Sound and Good ANC, the M3's are a great option. For me, the aesthetic and build quality were also plusses. For those who value ANC/Battery Life than sound quality, the Sony XM3's or Bose 700's are better choices. For me personally, I'm very happy I went with the M3's.",5
I ve used these headphones for several months now and they work very well. They pair quickly with my phone 95% of the time.  The sound quality is very nice. I have the bose earbuds too and obviously these headphones provide better sound quality. I like how it turns off automatically when you put the headphones around your neck. I like the soft leather ear muffs and the metal construction. You can get a little pinch if your finger is in the hinge when you open up the speakers but you only make that mistake once.,5
I have the Momentum 2 Wired headphones and I Loved the style and quality that I was waiting to get the noise canceling headphones and for what they are they are great. I am not audiofile but I enjoy them and will get a LOT of use out of them for sure and LOVE the style,5
Great sound real soft leather pairs up fast fast shipping,5
This is by far Sennheiser Momentum 3 is  the best headphone I've own. I got the Sony WH-1000XM3 Sony WH-1000XM2 Beats Studio 3. The Sennheiser is by far the best hands down.,5
"I bought and returned these headphones and bought the Momentum 2 wireless at half the price instead. I've been putting off writing this review for a while because I have too much to say. Gonna try to keep it brief. The other headphones I use and will draw comparisons from include the Sennheiser Momentum 2 Wireless, V-Moda Crossfade Wireless 2 (these have the best noise isolation of them all, but don't have noise cancelling), Sennheiser HD1. Also I used these with an LG V40 which has a Hi-Fi quad DAC when headphones are wired through the aux port. So I did not buy these exclusively for wireless use. Codec Pros & Cons - Con: pretty disappointed these 2019 headphones don't have LDAC or aptX HD. - Con: This is more of a software issue for LG Android users (maybe other phones too) but every time I connected these to my phone my phone's bluetooth codec defaulted to AAC, whereas aptX is arguably better. I had to go into developer options to manually change the setting every single time i turned on the headphones. Headphones Build Pros & Cons - Pro: bigger earcups that fully surround your ear - Pro: clasp isn't too tight - Pro: premium materials with lambskin and stainless steel - Con: large profile on head - Con: when I wear the headphones and move my head around with no music playing i can hear a faint clicking sound from the earcups. - Pro: earcups have extra sideways swivel compared to HD1 and Momentum 2. Allowing for a better seal -Con: earcups don't rotate in frame as much as the HD1 (the Momentum 2 also rotate like the HD1s but HD1s have the smoothest, easiest rotation). I liked this feature on the HD1s because I was able to rotate the earcups and have the headband rest far back on my to avoid messing up my hair. - Con: the headband is most comfortable on the HD1s (the Momentum 2 look like the same model, but the padding on the headband is stiffer) Sound Quality Pros & Cons - Con: if you want fully balanced headphones these aren't the ones for you. Coming from V-Moda headphones (lots of bass) I wanted something more balanced, but the bass in these is actually able to compete with V-Moda bass. - Pro: if you like bass the bass in these sounds more organic than the V-Modas. Listening to a drum pedal kick sounds more like a live drum kit when I was wearing the Momentum 3 - Con: the soundstage could be wider - I was able to balance the sound a bit with the provided app's equalizer. but don't buy these thinking you'll get studio monitors. Smart Pause Pros & Cons - Pro: pauses when i put them around my neck - Con: randomly pauses my music even while i'm wearing them. Turning the feature off and back on in the app helped fix this. - Pro: smart pause still works in wired mode but has an extra delay of 1-2 seconds - Con: when i had 2 sources connected at once Smart Pause would pause 1 source then start playing the 2nd source when I put the headphones back on Noise Cancelling Pros - can change level of noise cancelling - can turn off noise cancelling (seems like a given, but you're not able to on the Momentum 2) - tested on bus, metro, and planes (both turbine and propeller engines) and it blocks out the majority of the lower frequency sounds, but not the higher frequencies (train wheels rubbing on the track, high pitched propeller hum) - transparent hearing (although sound isn't as clear as simply removing the headphones) - NC works in wired mode Noise Cancelling Cons - Experienced a faint static sound in both speakers at different times. This only occurred when NC was enabled. - doesn't block out higher frequency sounds (most NC headphones don't) On/Off switch Pros & Cons -Pro: simply unfold to turn on -Con: headphones stay on all day unless you fold them back up. Now I've seen several people on YouTube claim you can turn them off by holding the bluetooth sync button while unfolding them. I can confirm that this ONLY turns off the Bluetooth. The headphones themselves are still being powered and the NC and Volume buttons are still functional. Wired Mode Pros & Cons - Pro: NC works when wired - Pro: Volume buttons work when wired - Pro: Smart Pause feature works (although with a short delay) - Pro: can play music with provided Type-C wire (wouldn't want to if you have an LG phone like me, but a good feature for phones with no aux port) - Con: Play/Pause/skip track button doesn't work, and the provided wire doesn't have any buttons on it. Smart Assistant button works pretty well. First time you click it your phone will ask you which assistant you want it to activate ( i have Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant). I'm able to get the Assistant to perform actions even when my phone is locked. This seems minor but it works better than my phone's dedicated assistant button which sometimes turns on the assistant but doesn't actually perform the requested action. Tile feature is a nice gimmick but I never lose track of my headphones so that's all it is for me. Being able to play your phone with the provided Type-C to Type-C USB cable is also a nice feature but once again just a gimmick to me because I have the LG V40 which only has a hi-fi quad DAC when wired through the aux port. Overall these are a 2019 model that has some nice additions (bigger earcups are really the only neutral improvement) and gimmicks added to it while still lacking significant, desired technological improvements (aptX HD, LDAC) and have too many problems for me to be satisfied spending over 500$. 6/10 - would be a higher score if the price was lower",3
"Yes the battery life is low, yes there are physical buttons, yes the noise cancelling is not the best in the world of headphones (in my tests, the Sony ones were)... All the above said, There are the best pair of headphones I've ever owned. 1) The best sound quality 2) The best fit 3) The best material quality I can honestly say I love these headphones. I compared them to pxc 550 and sony wh1000xm3. The sound quality is far superior to both headphones. I am OK with the limitations of the headphones because it promises no compromises when it comes to sound quality. I'm really satisfied with my purchase.",5
More comfortable with the bigger ear cups compare with HD1. Very disappointed with the sound quality and build quality. Going to keep my HD1 for another couple of years.,2
"I borrowed a pair of these headphones from a buddy of mine for a week to test out and I have to say, that I am quite disappointed. First off, the sound quality is amazing. Sennheiser is the leader in that space. They know how to create a balanced sound profile that's pleasant to the ears. However, I am CONSISTENTLY unable to connect my iPhone X to these headphones, even though both devices use Bluetooth 5.0. Bluetooth is turned on on my iPhone and yet every time I unfold these headphones, the woman says ""Power on. No connection."" And this happens EVERY TIME I power them off and back on again. So, guess what? I have to rely on the included cable to connect these headphones to my iPhone using Apple's 3.5mm to Lightning adapter. This is incredibly frustrating. You might say: ""There's a special button, which you need to press in order to initiate pairing."" Yes, this button is there, but 95% it does not work. Every time I press and hold for 5 seconds, it just makes a sound ""beeep"" and nothing happens. Pairing does not happen. I'm glad I only borrowed them for a week. I won't be buying one for myself.",2
"I've had both Sony's WH1000 XM4 (now returned) and the Momentum 3 now. I'm not an audiophile, but my priority was sound quality. Sound quality: There is simply no competition here. The Momentum just hits it out of the park! Not only does it support more BT audio codecs than the XM4 (resulting in better quality across platforms), it has MUCH better imaging and soundstaging compared to the XM4. You can hear each instrument and track separately and follow each one right to the end of the song! I also almost immediately started noticing new sounds in music I've been listening to for years. Truly amazing! Being a bass lover, I was skeptical about the Momentum, considering Sony headphones are always known as being better for bass. But nope! The bass is tighter and punches a lot harder with the Momentum, than with the XM4. There is also clear separation between low/mid/high bass with Momentum. With XM4 the bass sounds mixed, muddled and boomy. The Momentum is also just louder and more powerful than the XM4. With the latter I had to pump up the volume to 70% to hear details (giving me mild tinnitus after a few hours); I've never had to exceed 40% with the Momentum. Noise Cancellation: This wasn't my top priority (sound quality was), but I gotta hand this one to the XM4. The Momentum's ANC is pretty good, but it's nowhere near the XM4's. I didn't get a chance to test in a super loud environment (like an airplane) though. In any case, if ANC is your no.1 reason to buy, go with the XM4. Comfort: This one is a little more difficult to judge. The XM4 is lighter and you can wear it for hours without feeling a thing. The Momentum is heavier by about 50g, and you feel the weight on your head after an hour or so. The XM4's earpads are softer than the Momentum's, but have much less ""inner"" space for the ears (affecting comfort as well as the audio quality if you have bigger ears like I do). I'd say for me, comfort is a draw, with maybe a slight edge for the XM4. If you have smaller ears though, XM4 easily wins. Build: The Momentum, with its metal headband and leather earpads, is the clear winner here, over the XM4's plastic band and foam earpads which feels flimsy and prone to breakage. Connectivity: I didn't face any problems as such with either headphone here. The XM4 did automatically and consistently connect to whatever device I paired it with and was active at the moment. With the Momentum I had to manually connect from the device if I switched to a different one, but I didn't think it was a big deal, since I mostly use just my laptop. Battery Life: Specs wise XM4 should be the clear winner here (30 hrs vs 17 hrs). But as mentioned above, since I was always listening on 70% volume with the XM4, I ran out of juice REAL quick (about 14-15 hours across 3 days). I've been listening to the Momentum for at least 17 hours now and it's still going strong. In the end, I've decided to keep the Momentum despite its flaws. The sound quality is just too good for me to return it.",4
"Pros: - Bass is unreal.  You feel it BIG time. - Comfortable ear cups though a tad bit heavy. - Connects flawlessly with the newest iPhone 11 Pro max Cons: - Crackles badly on macbook's (have the latest MacBook Pro on the latest OS) - Doesn't connect to Apple TV - Says you can connect to two devices last once...doesn't work for me..Just trying to find the device on my apple products is a pain...and often doesn't work with the exception of my phone. - Honestly it kinda looks goofy....but that's subjective - Travel case is just about useless...provides no protection at all and it looks/feels like something that would get dirty really fast I love Sennheiser...so much that I am always willing to give up a few flaws to enjoy the sound that they offer...I don't care that the ANC isn't on the level of Sony or Bose as long as it has ANC...I don;'t care that it's my least favourite aesthetically of the three competitors (Sony mxwyidh300000 and the Bose 700)...I just wanted them to function and just simply WORK... however, this one just simply doesn't function with my ecosystem..I want to be able to watch movies with it on my Apple TV, use it as my headphones for my MacBook and listen to music on my phone...unfortunately, the only thing it can achieve is the latter and that's simply not good enough to justify the price tag. It;'s supposed to connect to 2 devices at once...but while I'm typing this review, I'm trying to figure out why my MacBook Pro can't seem to connect to it after I've connected it to my phone...and when I forget device on my phone, my MacBook connects but then my iPhone needs the app to reconnect the headphones...and guess what happens next?  Yup, the MacBook can't connect again...It's a vicious cycle of ""forget this device"" over and over again... I only give it two stars because I simply love the sound...it's just simply not for people with apple systems... [UPDATE] so it appears that the app is what throws off the connection all along.  If you connect it as a regular Bluetooth device without going through the app then you can connect it to multiple devices.  If you use the app, then it seems to only be connected to the phone and won’t be discoverable by any of my other products.  It’s a shame still because the app has we settings and it’s how you know your battery life as well as whether or not you need to update the firmware. As for the MacBook problem, it still persists.  However, if I do a fresh restart and don’t use the MacBook at all, it’ll play Spotify perfectly but the moment I start using apps, the crackling kicks in.",2
"Los audifonos son muy cómodos, con excelente acabado y calidad. El sonido es muy bueno, cuenta con una app que funciona aunque podría ser mejor. Lo que no me gusta es que no puedo cambiar de dispositivo cuando yo quiero, se conectan los dos al mismo tiempo y si uno suena el otro se desconecta y llega a tener problemas para reconectarse. Comparado con los Bosé, estos se pueden cambiar de dispositivos a voluntad. En terminos generales me ha gustado mucho la experiencia, no son cansados y son muy ligeros en la cabeza",5
"Excelente sonido, lo comparé con el Bose 35 Y me quedo con estos audífonos por sonido y comodidad. Su equalizador mejora mucho la calidad de la música, y cuentan con buen volumen.",5
"My main headphones are the Sennheiser HD 600 open-back but I needed a bluetooth closed-back headphone for audio on the go. The HD 600 are said to have a very neutral sound signature and so that's what i'll be comparing the Momentum 3 to. I'll also be talking about my experience with these headphones in a very quiet environment at close to minimum audio volume. The momentum 3 overall have a slightly worse sound quality than the HD 600. The highs are slightly too high, sometimes to the point of being a bit on the shrill side. This is noticeable with instruments like violins. The lows are a bit muffled so if you are looking for a bassy sound signature, these are not the headphones for it. Otherwise they sound mostly neutral, similar to the HD 600, except that instrument separation is slightly better with the HD 600. If you like the HD 600, you'll probably get used to the Momentum 3. I mostly listen with ANC on because with ANC off there's this ""underwater"" sound that's common to most closed back headphones (and it drowns out the sound the headphones make at low audio volume). Something to note is that even with ANC on there's a slight whine. Not sure how to describe it, but it's a bit as if you lower the pitch of a tree cricket singing. It's not distracting but it's audible if you are in a quiet environment and you pay attention. I haven't tried transparency mode much at all. If I wanted to hear my surroundings I'd be using an open-back headphone. So no opinion on that. Haven't put the battery or the microphone to test. Will update this review if I find those unsatisfactory once I use the Momentum 3 a bit more.",4
"Sumamente recomendables, llevo ya unas semanas utilizandolos y sin ninguna queja: - Inalámbrico: el modo bluetooth es bueno, superior a otros audífonos inalambricos y no presenta problemas de conección ni latencia - Con cable: la mejor calidad de audio, toman un carácter y detalle excelente cuando se usan con cable, ojo, requiere estar encendidos para funcionar el máximo potencial - Comodidad: súper cómodos, los puedes usar horas sin que sean cansados a pesar de que no son ligeros, solo llega a sentirse el peso en la cabeza pero nada incómodo - Batería: A pesar de que dura menos que la competencia no es un punto de quiebre para mí, podría mejorar pero es lo suficientemente buena -ANC: Talvez su punto más débil, no es mala la cancelación de ruido pero tampoco es la mejor, es suficiente para lograr concentrarte en tu música pero no bloquea todos los ruidos exteriores, me gusta que no genera presión -Materiales: todo se siente de excelente calidad, lo único que me queda a deber es el cable auxiliar porque no se siente acordé a este producto En conclusión es una compra segura, lo recomiendo",5
"In order to find the best set of ANC headphones, I did a shootout of basically every model in this price range available. I ended up keeping these. They have the best sound quality in this price range by far. Excellent soundstage, punchy (but not overbearing) low end, and a crisp high end, though the in certain frequency ranges (I hear it moreso in the 4-6k range) is turned down. The mids are present and are fairly accurate. These don't have a neutral sound, but the instrument separation is very good, to where you get an excellent blend of ""excitement"" in your listening experience with the amplified low end, whist still being able to hear everything clearly. This was a good direction to go on Sennheiser's part. The noise cancelling on these is the weak point. If you prioritize sound quality, then you may not care. But compared to the Sony XM4s or the Bose QC35s, these do not stack up at all. I hope Sennheiser improves in this area for the Momentum 4's. These are fairly comfortable but they are weighty. I wish the headband had a bit more padding. The battery life is fairly poor for headphones in this price range. All in all, a great sounding set of ANC headphones with some room for improvement.",4
"Tienen un excelente sonido, para escuchar musica son mejor opcion que los bose 700 y los sony, pero en cancelación de ruido se quedan un poco cortos, si están en ambientes muy pesados en ruido cumplen pero no tanto como los otros. La función de prendido y apagado es buena pero puede volverse incomoda en ocasiones, no recomiendo llevarlos sin estuche. Son muy comodos y la aplicacion es muy facil de usar. La batería te va a durar lo suficiente para un dia entero pero no destaca en este punto a comparacion de la competencia, si eres de usar mucho los audifonos si los cargaras seguido pero nunca te hara falta pila al menos en un dia de uso. El sonido es envolvente, sin distorsion con graves de buen nivel sin exageracion ni perdida de altos y bajos (no confundan bajos con graves, es un error muy comun). Si no te importa mucho la cancelacion de ruido y la bateria son excelentes para ti, si necesitas algo que destaque en esos dos puntos anteriores no lo recomiendo.",4
"As everyone else has mentioned. Sound quality is absolutely fantastic. ANC is not as strong as Bose but I am not travelling all the time, neither walking on noisy street. So I am good with it. Battery life 17hr is more than enough I never hear more than 3-4hr in stretch. So not an issue at all to me it’s all marketing addon. But what the real stuff is sound quality and they beat everyone head down. They are so good, I had M2 which I liked but when first time I put these on I liked it even more there is significant improvement in features and sound quality from M2. I would recommend to give it a try. Have Fun.",5
"although the sound quality is truly unmatched, there's just far too many downsides. - the battery life is significantly shorter than its competition, especially with ANC on - it is incredibly uncomfortable and puts a lot of pressure on my head - the headband slider is really annoying and constantly readjusts itself - when in multipoint, whenever a notification is received on the other device, it will pause the playing music for about 20 seconds to play the notification sound, with no way of disabling this ""feature"" in the companion app - every time you readjust the right headphones, it will stop playing music. if you are in a call, it will put the call on hold. the smart pause functionality is in general very spotty and unreliable (and when a call is put on hold, the other party is able to see that)",1
"Amazing sound some of the best closed back headphones under a thousand. You definitely get your money worth with Sennheiser. Very comfortable, great features. Just kick back relax and let the sound flood your body. If you want headphones with noise cancelling while studying at school or noise locations then don’t get these, go for the Sony XM2 or 3.",5
"Not my first pair on Momentums. I find the Sennheiser brand the ideal choice if you are looking for sound quality.  This particular version does have some feature that can be annoying. Like the ear proximity sensors that cause them to pause your music. I can see the point of it, but it is fairly sensitive and easy to trigger when lying down or yawning. I would also recommend using the Android app Wavelet to bring the sound back to manufacturers specs. Having high quality head phones, like these ones, should not be poisoned by phone music players tendencies to over EQ. As for the insane pricing - I don't really mind. I tend to keep them for a long time. Enjoy!",5
"I love the clarity and bass that is adjustable with the Sennheiser app, the headset itself is very comfortable. The only caveat I have with this headset is that in order to turn it off, you need to fold it up. Before this headset, I used the Sennheiser HD 4.50 BTNC Bluetooth Active Noise Cancellation Headphone, and I found that that headset had a stronger noise canceling, however, it is definitely not as clear as this one nor does it have as good of a bass quality; with even medium music levels, it is difficult to hear others or background noise so the noise cancellation is not as big of a deal in my opinion. I personally like the step up with the ability to turn off noise canceling when in Bluetooth mode which is something you cannot do with the 4.50 BTNCs. The real leather is a nice addition and has that authentic smell, the metal is not flimsy from what I can tell and the ear cuffs are larger than the 4.50 BTNCs thusly making it bulkier which I think makes it more stylish. Overall great and enjoyable with pleasant sound quality.",5
"If you want good noise canceling get the Sony or bose,these aren't bad but not as good as the other two, you want the best battery don't get these, but if what you want is the absolute best sounding headphones get these,you won't be disappointed and the battery life I've never had a problem with ,every music type sounds great on these",5
They are fine. A smoother tone than the Sony’s and more comfortable than the Sony’s or Bose but the sound quality is not mind blowing as I am using them. The low pressure noise cancelling level is perfect for indoor use and easy on the ears however  it does not block out voices/conversations or radios.  Which I suppose makes them perfect for eaves dropping.,4
Me gusto mucho la calidad del sonido la comodidad y que con estos audífonos puedo escuchar música en alta fidelidad y percibir la diferencia con la que no lo es.,5
"Great sound, but lacking ANC and very uncomfortable band for long hours of use. I love the sound quality, but I have a sensitive head and I use this for work. Unfortunately, the band isn't comfortable and it feels like it's digging through my head.",4
"These headphones tick every box. They’re pricey but if you’re even looking at them, you’re probably an audiophile and won’t be disappointed with these if this is your price range. The battery life actually surprised me as I wasn’t expecting them to last as long as they do.",5
"The music quality is superb and the wireless use is intuitive. However, I noticed a flaw after using it for a day there was a winding up sound like the HBO intro that comes up every time I stopped any audio be it music on my phone or from youtube videos.",3
"Smart Pause persistently pauses playback every time you turn your head, yawn, or clench your teeth. During calls this results in persistent toggling of ""Mute On"" and ""Mute Off"", driving you and the person on the other end insane. Taking off the headphones and repositioning them seems to occasionally fix the problem, but overall a very poor experience if you do anything other than stare at a screen all day.",2
"Too much static. Unbearable and intolerable for this price. When the music was clear it was good, but the static was non negligeable. And the controls were not so easy to use.",1
"Sound quality is great , noise cancelation enough, battery life Ok.  Use usb type C to type C to get best sound quality",5
Best sounding headphones out there. They do fit better than the momentum 2. Totally recommend if you are looking for great sound. Noise canceling works but there is better headphones in that category.,5
"Each time after a few minutes of use, I experienced severe earache and headache.",4
"Love the way these sound, noise cancellation is very good.",5
"I started a return request because I couldn't get the wired connection working but gave it one last try before packaging them up. Be sure the wired connection on the headphones is inserted and twisted all the way. It took me a bit to fiddle with it. Once it, the sound is amazing!",4
Sound stage is wide with focused low but details are missing with high and mid. ANC is not very good compared to other competitors.,3
"Son muy buenos, pero tienen bajo volumen, para mí gusto personal. La cancelación de ruido es buena pero no es la mejor, el micrófono para las llamadas es muy bueno para mí opinión.",4
DO NOT PURCHASE BECAUSE YOU WONT BE REFUNDED IF THERE IS A PROBLEM. THE ITEM WOULD NOT PAIR AND NO REFUNDED WAS GIVEN.,1
"For this price, I assumed the battery life and connection problems would be far better. Unfortunately I only opened it past the return window so now I'm stuck with it.",2
Definitely the best headphones I have ever had. Though they were not cheap (600$ Canadian with taxes). I thought it was a price worth paying though since I use headphones for hours each day.,5
Excellente  qualité.,5
"Good product, very good sound quality but mediocre noise cancelling. Comfortable on head and has decently sized earcups to go around the ear.",5
Great for classical music lover Its always uncomfortable for people like me who has tiny ears to wear headphones Anyway love sennheiser,5
Sound is great! Noise cancellation function needs to improve.,5
"amazing sound, comfort , design and smells expensive",5
très mauvaise,1
Great sound quality and bass,5
transpreancy doesnt work,5
These headphones are great!,5
Goooooooooooood,5
